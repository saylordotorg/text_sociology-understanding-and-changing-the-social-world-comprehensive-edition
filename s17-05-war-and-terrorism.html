Although war and terrorism have been part of the human experience for thousands of years, their manifestation in the contemporary era is particularly frightening, thanks to evermore powerful weapons, including nuclear arms, that threaten human existence. Because governments play a fundamental role in both war and terrorism, a full understanding of politics and government requires examination of key aspects of these two forms of armed conflict. We start with war and then turn to terrorism.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">War</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s01_p01">Wars occur both between nations and within nations, when two or more factions engage in armed conflict. War between nations is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international war</a><span class="glossdef">War between nations.</span></span>, while war within nations is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil war</a><span class="glossdef">War within nations.</span></span>. The most famous civil war to Americans, of course, is the American Civil War, also called the War Between the States, that pitted the North against the South from 1861 through 1865. More than 600,000 soldiers on both sides died on the battlefield or from disease, a number that exceeds American deaths in all the other wars the United States has fought. More than 100 million soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died during the international and civil wars of the 20th century (Leitenberg, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_033">Leitenberg, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s01_s01_p01">The enormity of war has stimulated scholarly interest in why humans wage war. A popular explanation for war derives from evolutionary biology. According to this argument, war is part of our genetic heritage because the humans who survived tens of thousands of years ago were those who were most able, by virtue of their temperament and physicality, to take needed resources from other humans they attacked and to defend themselves from attackers. In this manner, a genetic tendency for physical aggression and warfare developed and thus still exists today. In support of this evolutionary argument, some scientists note that chimpanzees and other primates also engage in group aggression against others of their species (Wrangham, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_035">Wrangham, R. W. (2004). Killer species. <em class="emphasis">Daedalus, 133</em>(4), 25–35.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s01_s01_p02">However, other scientists dispute the evolutionary explanation for several reasons (Begley, 2009; Roscoe, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_036">Begley, S. (2009, June 29). Don’t blame the caveman. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> 52–62; Roscoe, P. (2007). Intelligence, coalitional killing, and the antecedents of war. <em class="emphasis">American Anthropologist, 109</em>(3), 487–495.</span> First, the human brain is far more advanced than the brains of other primates, and genetic instincts that might drive their behavior do not necessarily drive human behavior. Second, many societies studied by anthropologists have been very peaceful, suggesting that a tendency to warfare is more cultural than biological. Third, most people are not violent, and most soldiers have to be resocialized (in boot camp or its equivalent) to overcome their deep moral convictions against killing; if warlike tendencies were part of human genetic heritage, these convictions would not exist.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s01_s01_p03">If warfare is not biological in origin, then it is best understood as a social phenomenon, one that has its roots in the decisions of political and military officials. Sometimes, as with the U.S. entrance into World War II after Pearl Harbor, these decisions are sincere and based on a perceived necessity to defend a nation’s people and resources, and sometimes these decisions are based on cynicism and deceit. A prime example of the latter dynamic is the Vietnam War. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, in which Congress authorized President Lyndon Johnson to wage an undeclared war in Vietnam, was passed after North Vietnamese torpedo boats allegedly attacked U.S. ships. However, later investigation revealed that the attack never occurred and that the White House lied to Congress and the American people (Wells, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_037">Wells, T. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The war within: America’s battle over Vietnam</em>. Berkeley: University of California Press.</span> Four decades later, questions of possible deceit were raised after the United States began the war against Iraq because of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. These weapons were never found, and critics charged that the White House had fabricated and exaggerated evidence of the weapons in order to win public and congressional support for the war (Danner, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_038">Danner, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_p01">Terrorism is hardly a new phenomenon, but Americans became horrifyingly familiar with it on September 11, 2001, when about 3,000 people died after planes hijacked by Middle Eastern terrorists crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. The attacks on 9/11 remain in the nation’s consciousness, and many readers may know someone who died on that terrible day. The attacks also spawned a vast national security network that now reaches into almost every aspect of American life. This network is so secretive, so huge, and so expensive that no one really knows precisely how large it is and how much it costs (Priest &amp; Arkin, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_042">Priest, D., &amp; Arkin, W. M. (2010, July 20). A hidden world, growing beyond control. <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>, p. A1.</span> Questions of how best to deal with terrorism continue to be debated, and there are few, if any, easy answers to these questions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_p02">Not surprisingly, sociologists and other scholars have written many articles and books about terrorism. This section draws on their work to discuss the definition of terrorism, the major types of terrorism, explanations for terrorism, and strategies for dealing with terrorism. An understanding of all these issues is essential to make sense of the concern and controversy about terrorism that exists throughout the world today.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s01_p01">There is an old saying that “one person’s freedom fighter is another person’s terrorist.” This saying indicates one of the defining features of terrorism but also some of the problems in coming up with a precise definition of it. Some years ago, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) waged a campaign of terrorism against the British government and its people as part of its effort to drive the British out of Northern Ireland. Many people in Northern Ireland and elsewhere hailed IRA members as freedom fighters, while many other people condemned them as cowardly terrorists. Although most of the world labeled the 9/11 attacks as terrorism, some individuals applauded them as acts of heroism. These examples indicate that there is only a thin line, if any, between terrorism on the one hand and freedom fighting and heroism on the other hand. Just as beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, so is terrorism. The same type of action is either terrorism or freedom fighting, depending on who is characterizing the action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s01_p02">Although dozens of definitions of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">terrorism</a><span class="glossdef">The use of unexpected violence to intimidate or coerce people in the pursuit of political or social objectives.</span></span> exist, most take into account what are widely regarded as the three defining features of terrorism: (a) the use of violence; (b) the goal of making people afraid; and (c) the desire for political, social, economic, and/or cultural change. A popular definition by political scientist Ted Robert Gurr (1989, p. 201)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_043">Gurr, T. R. (1989). Political terrorism: Historical antecedents and contemporary trends. In T. R. Gurr (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Violence in America: Protest, rebellion, reform</em> (Vol. 2, pp. 201–230).

A typology of terrorism again by Gurr (1989)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_044">Gurr, T. R. (1989). Political terrorism: Historical antecedents and contemporary trends. In T. R.

Sometimes the motivation is racial, ethnic, religious, or other hatred, and sometimes the motivation is to resist social change. The violence of racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan was vigilante terrorism, as was the violence used for more than two centuries by white Europeans against Native Americans. What we now call “hate crime” is a contemporary example of vigilante terrorism.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Insurgent terrorism</a><span class="glossdef">Terrorism committed by private citizens against their own government or against businesses and institutions seen as representing the “establishment.”</span></span> is committed by private citizens against their own government or against businesses and institutions seen as representing the “establishment.” Insurgent terrorism is committed by both left-wing groups and right-wing groups and thus has no political connotation. U.S. history is filled with insurgent terrorism, starting with some of the actions the colonists waged against British forces before and during the American Revolution, when “the meanest and most squalid sort of violence was put to the service of revolutionary ideals and objectives” (Brown, 1989, p. 25).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_045">Brown, R. M. (1989). Historical patterns of violence. In T. R. Gurr (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Violence in America: Protest, rebellion, reform</em> (Vol. 2, pp. 23–61). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.</span> An example here is tarring and feathering: hot tar and then feathers were smeared over the unclothed bodies of Tories. Some of the labor violence committed after the Civil War also falls under the category of insurgent terrorism, as does some of the violence committed by left-wing groups during the 1960s and 1970s. A relatively recent example of right-wing insurgent terrorism is the infamous 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols that killed 168 people.</p>

This is the type that has most concerned Americans at least since 9/11, yet 9/11 was not the first time Americans had been killed by international terrorism. A decade earlier, a truck bombing at the World Trade Center killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. In 1988, 189 Americans were among the 259 passengers and crew who died when a plane bound for New York exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland; agents from Libya were widely thought to have planted the bomb. Despite all these American deaths, transnational terrorism has actually been much more common in several other nations: London, Madrid, and various cities in the Middle East have frequently been the targets of international terrorists.</p>

As just one example, the violent response of Southern white law enforcement officers to the civil rights protests of the 1960s amounted to state terrorism, as officers murdered or beat hundreds of activists during this period. Although state terrorism is usually linked to authoritarian regimes, many observers say that the U.S. government also engaged in state terror during the 19th century, when U.S. troops killed thousands of Native Americans (Brown, 1971).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_047">Brown, D.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s03_p01">Why does terrorism occur? It is easy to assume that terrorists must have psychological problems that lead them to have sadistic personalities, and that they are simply acting irrationally and impulsively. However, most scholars agree that terrorists are psychologically normal despite their murderous violence and, in fact, are little different from other types of individuals who use violence for political ends. As one scholar observed,</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s03_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s03_p02">Most terrorists are no more or less fanatical than the young men who charged into Union cannonfire at Gettysburg or those who parachuted behind German lines into France. They are no more or less cruel and coldblooded than the Resistance fighters who executed Nazi officials and collaborators in Europe, or the American GI’s ordered to “pacify” Vietnamese villages.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s03_p04">If terrorism cannot be said to stem from individuals’ psychological problems, then what are its roots? In answering this question, many scholars say that terrorism has structural roots. In this view, terrorism is a rational response, no matter horrible it may be, to perceived grievances regarding economic, social, and/or political conditions (LaFree &amp; Dugan, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_049">LaFree, G., &amp; Dugan, L.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s03_p06">As this assessment indicates, structural conditions do not justify terrorism, of course, but they do help explain why some individuals decide to commit it.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Stopping Terrorism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p01">Efforts to stop terrorism take two forms (White, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_051">White, J. R. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Terrorism and homeland security: An introduction</em> (7th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> The first form involves attempts to capture known terrorists and to destroy their camps and facilities and is commonly called a <em class="emphasis">law enforcement</em> or <em class="emphasis">military</em> approach. The second form stems from the recognition of the structural roots of terrorism just described and is often called a <em class="emphasis">structural-reform</em> approach. Each approach has many advocates among terrorism experts, and each approach has many critics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p02">Law enforcement and military efforts have been known to weaken terrorist forces, but terrorist groups have persisted despite these measures. Worse yet, these measures may ironically inspire terrorists to commit further terrorism and increase public support for their cause. Critics also worry that the military approach endangers civil liberties, as the debate over the U.S. response to terrorism since 9/11 so vividly illustrates (Cole &amp; Lobel, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_052">Cole, D., &amp; Lobel, J. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Less safe, less free: Why America is losing the war on terror</em>. New York, NY: New Press.</span> This debate took an interesting turn in late 2010 amid the increasing use of airport scanners that generate body images. Many people criticized the scanning as an invasion of privacy, and they also criticized the invasiveness of the “pat-down” searches that were used for people who chose not to be scanned (Reinberg, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_053">Reinberg, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p03">In view of all these problems, many terrorism experts instead favor the structural-reform approach, which they say can reduce terrorism by improving or eliminating the conditions that give rise to the discontent that leads individuals to commit terrorism. Here again the assessment of the heads of the 9/11 Commission illustrates this view:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_bl01">

America’s long-term security relies on being viewed not as a threat but as a source of opportunity and hope. (Kean &amp; Hamilton, 2007, p. B1)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn14_054">Kean, T.

                    <li>War takes an enormous human and financial toll. Many critics dispute the evolutionary argument that a tendency toward warfare is hardwired into human genetics.</li>
                    <li>Terrorism involves the use of intimidating violence to achieve political ends. Whether a given act of violence is perceived as terrorism or as freedom fighting often depends on whether someone approves of the goal of the violence.</li>
                    <li>The law enforcement/military approach to countering terrorism may weaken terrorist groups, but it also may increase their will to fight and popular support for their cause and endanger civil liberties.</li>

                <h3 class="title">Toward a More Perfect Union: What Sociology Suggests</h3>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p05">Sociological theory and research are once again relevant for addressing certain issues raised by studies of politics and government. Several issues especially come to mind.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p06">The first is the possible monopolization and misuse of power by a relatively small elite composed of the powerful or the “haves,” as they are often called. If elite theories are correct, this small elite takes advantage of its place at the top of American society and its concomitant wealth, power, and influence to benefit its own interests. Sociological work that supports the assumptions of elite theories does not necessarily imply any specific measures to reduce the elite’s influence, but it does suggest the need for consumer groups and other public-interest organizations to remain vigilant about elite misuse of power and to undertake efforts to minimize this misuse.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p07">The second issue is the lack of political participation from the segments of American society that traditionally have very little power: the poor, the uneducated, and people of color. Because voting and other forms of political participation are much more common among the more educated and wealthy segments of society, the relative lack of participation by those without power helps ensure that they remain without power. Sociological research on political participation thus underscores the need to promote voting and other political participation by the poor and uneducated if American democratic and egalitarian ideals are to be achieved. This need also applies to reversing the disenfranchisement of felons, as discussed in the “Sociology Making a Difference” box that appeared earlier in this chapter.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch14_s05_s02_s04_p08">A third issue is how best to counter terrorism. Sociology’s emphasis on the need to address the structural roots of social issues has been a theme of this book and was first highlighted in the discussion of the sociological imagination in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch01#barkan-ch01">Chapter 1 "Sociology and the Sociological Perspective"</a>. This emphasis is reflected in the structural-reform strategy for countering terrorism discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch14#barkan-ch14">Chapter 14 "Politics and Government"</a>, <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch14_s05">Section 14.5 "War and Terrorism"</a>. Efforts to counter terrorism that do not address the structural conditions underlying many acts of terrorism ultimately help ensure that new acts of terrorism will arise. To say this is not meant to excuse or justify any terrorism, but it is meant to recognize an important reality that must be kept in mind as the world continues to deal with the threat of terrorism.</p>
