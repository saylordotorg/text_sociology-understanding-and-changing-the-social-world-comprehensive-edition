    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_p01">Because religion is such an important part of our society, sociologists and other observers have examined how religious thought and practice have changed in the last few decades. Two trends have been studied in particular: (a) secularization and (b) the rise of religious conservatism.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Secularization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Secularization</a><span class="glossdef">The weakening importance of religion in a society.</span></span> refers to the weakening importance of religion in a society. It plays less of a role in people’s lives, as they are less guided in their daily behavior by religious beliefs. The influence of religious organizations in society also declines, and some individual houses of worship give more emphasis to worldly concerns such as soup kitchens than to spiritual issues. There is no doubt that religion is less important in modern society than it was before the rise of science in the 17th and 18th centuries. Scholars of religion have tried to determine the degree to which the United States has become more secularized during the last few decades (Finke &amp; Stark, 2005; Fenn, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_038">Finke, R., &amp; Stark, R.

(2001). <em class="emphasis">Beyond idols: The shape of a secular society</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s01_p02">The best evidence shows that religion has declined in importance since the 1960s but still remains a potent force in American society as a whole and for the individual lives of Americans (Finke &amp; Scheitle, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_039">Finke, R., &amp; Scheitle, C. (2005). Accounting for the uncounted: Computing correctives for the 2000 RCMS data. <em class="emphasis">Review of Religious Research, 47</em>, 5–22.</span> Although membership in mainstream Protestant denominations has declined since the 1960s, membership in conservative denominations has risen. Most people (92% in the Pew survey) still believe in God, and, as already noted, more than half of all Americans pray daily.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s01_p03">Scholars also point to the continuing importance of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil religion</a><span class="glossdef">The devotion of a nation’s citizens to their society and government.</span></span>, or the devotion of a nation’s citizens to their society and government (Santiago, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_040">Santiago, J. (2009). From “civil religion” to nationalism as the religion of modern times: Rethinking a complex relationship. <em class="emphasis">Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 48</em>(2), 394–401.</span> In the United States, love of country—patriotism—and admiration for many of its ideals are widespread. Citizens routinely engage in rituals, such as reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the national anthem, that express their love of the United States. These beliefs and practices are the secular equivalent of traditional religious beliefs and practices and thus a functional equivalent of religion.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rise of Religious Conservatism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s02_p01">The rise of religious conservatism also challenges the notion that secularization is displacing religion in American life. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Religious conservatism</a><span class="glossdef">In the U.S. context, the belief that the Bible is the actual word of God.</span></span> in the U.S. context is the belief that the Bible is the actual word of God. As noted earlier, religious conservatism includes the various Baptist denominations and any number of evangelical organizations, and its rapid rise was partly the result of fears that the United States was becoming too secularized. Many religious conservatives believe that a return to the teachings of the Bible and religious spirituality is necessary to combat the corrupting influences of modern life (Almond, Appleby, &amp; Sivan, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_041">Almond, G. A., Appleby, R. S., &amp; Sivan, E. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Strong religion: The rise of fundamentalisms around the world</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s02_p02">Today about one-third of Americans state a religious preference for a conservative denomination (Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_042">Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life. (2008). <em class="emphasis">U.S. religious landscape survey</em>. Washington, DC: Pew Research Center.</span> Because of their growing numbers, religious conservatives have been the subject of increasing research. They tend to hold politically conservative views on many issues, including abortion and the punishment of criminals, and are more likely than people with other religious beliefs to believe in such things as the corporal punishment of children (Burdette, Ellison, &amp; Hill, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_043">Burdette, A. M., Ellison, C. G., &amp; Hill, T. D. (2005). Conservative protestantism and tolerance toward homosexuals: An examination of potential mechanisms. <em class="emphasis">Sociological Inquiry, 75</em>(2), 177–196.</span> They are also more likely to believe in traditional roles for women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s02_p03">Closely related to the rise of religious conservatism has been the increasing influence of what has been termed the “new religious right” in American politics (Martin, 2005; Capps, 1990; Moen, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_044">Martin, W. C. (2005). <em class="emphasis">With God on our side: The rise of the religious Right in America</em>. New York, NY: Broadway Books; Capps, W. H. (1990). <em class="emphasis">The new religious Right: Piety, patriotism, and politics</em>. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press; Moen, M. (1992). <em class="emphasis">The transformation of the Christian Right</em>. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press.</span> Since the 1980s, the religious right has been a potent force in the political scene at both the national and local levels, with groups like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition effective in raising money, using the media, and lobbying elected officials. As its name implies, the religious right tries to advance a conservative political agenda consistent with conservative religious concerns. Among other issues, it opposes legal abortion, gay rights, and violence and sex in the media, and it also advocates an increased religious presence in public schools. Although the influence of the religious right has waned since the 1990s, its influence on American politics is bound to be controversial for many years to come.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Addressing Religious Issues: What Sociology Suggests</h3>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s02_p04">Sociological theory and research are relevant for understanding and addressing certain religious issues. One major issue today is religious intolerance. Émile Durkheim did not stress the hatred and conflict that religion has promoted over the centuries, but this aspect of conflict theory’s view of religion should not be forgotten. Certainly religious tolerance should be promoted among all peoples, and strategies for doing so include education efforts about the world’s religions and interfaith activities for youth and adults. The Center for Religious Tolerance (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.c-r-t.org/index.php">http://www.c-r-t.org/index.php</a>), headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, is one of the many local and national organizations in the United States that strive to promote interfaith understanding. In view of the hostility toward Muslims that increased in the United States after 9/11, it is perhaps particularly important for education efforts and other activities to promote understanding of Islam.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch17_s06_s02_p05">Religion may also help address other social issues. In this regard, we noted earlier that religious belief and practice seem to promote physical health and psychological well-being. To the extent this is true, efforts that promote the practice of faith may enhance one’s physical and mental health.. In view of the health problems of older people and also their greater religiosity, some scholars urge that such efforts be especially undertaken for people in their older years (Moberg, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn17_045">Moberg, D. O. (2008). Spirituality and aging: Research and implications. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Religion, Spirituality &amp; Aging, 20</em>, 95–134.</span> We also noted that religiosity helps reduce drinking, drug use, and sexual behavior among adolescents and perhaps among adults. This does not mean that religion should be forced on anyone against his or her will, but this body of research does suggest that efforts by houses of worship to promote religious activities among their adolescents and younger children may help prevent or otherwise minimize risky behaviors during this important period of the life course.</p>
