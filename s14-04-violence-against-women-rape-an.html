    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_p01">When we consider interpersonal violence of all kinds—homicide, assault, robbery, and rape and sexual assault—men are more likely than women to be victims of violence. While true, this fact obscures another fact: women are far more likely than men to be raped and sexually assaulted. They are also much more likely to be portrayed as victims of pornographic violence on the Internet and in videos, magazines, and other outlets. Finally, women are more likely than men to be victims of <em class="emphasis">domestic violence</em>, or violence between spouses and others with intimate relationships. The gendered nature of these acts against women distinguishes them from the violence men suffer. Violence is directed against men not because they are men per se, but because of anger, jealousy, and the sociological reasons discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch05#barkan-ch05">Chapter 5 "Social Structure and Social Interaction"</a>’s treatment of deviance and crime. But rape and sexual assault, domestic violence, and pornographic portrayals of violence are directed against women precisely because they are women. These acts are thus an extreme extension of the gender inequality women face in other areas of life. We discuss rape and pornography here but will leave domestic violence for <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch11#barkan-ch11">Chapter 11 "Gender and Gender Inequality"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rape</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_p01">Susan Griffin (1971, p. 26)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_075">Griffin, S. (1971, September). Rape: The all-American crime. <em class="emphasis">Ramparts, 10</em>, 26–35.</span> began a classic essay on rape in 1971 with this startling statement:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_p02">I have never been free of the fear of rape. From a very early age I, like most women, have thought of rape as a part of my natural environment—something to be feared and prayed against like fire or lightning. I never asked why men raped; I simply thought it one of the many mysteries of human nature.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_p03">What do we know about rape? Why do men rape? Our knowledge about the extent and nature of rape and reasons for it comes from three sources: the FBI Uniform Crime Reports and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), both discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch05#barkan-ch05">Chapter 5 "Social Structure and Social Interaction"</a>, and surveys of and interviews with women and men conducted by academic researchers. From these sources we have a fairly good if not perfect idea of how much rape occurs, the context in which it occurs, and the reasons for it. What do we know?</p>
        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Extent and Context of Rape</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s01_p01">According to the Uniform Crime Reports, about 88,100 reported rapes (including attempts) occurred in the United States in 2009 (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_076">Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Crime in the United States, 2009</em>. Washington, DC: Author.</span> Because women often do not tell police they were raped, the NCVS probably yields a better estimate of rape. According to the NCVS, almost 126,000 rapes and sexual assaults occurred in 2009 (Truman &amp; Rand, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_077">Truman, J. L., &amp; Rand, M. R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Criminal victimization, 2009</em>. Washington, DC: Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.</span> Other research indicates that up to one-third of U.S. women will experience a rape or sexual assault, including attempts, at least once in their lives (Barkan, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_078">Barkan, S. E. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Criminology: A sociological understanding</em> (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> A study of a random sample of 420 Toronto women involving intensive interviews yielded even higher figures: 56% said they had experienced at least one rape or attempted rape, and two-thirds said they had experienced at least one rape or sexual assault, including attempts. The researchers, Melanie Randall and Lori Haskell (1995, p. 22),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_079">Randall, M., &amp; Haskell, L. (1995). Sexual violence in women’s lives: Findings from the Women’s Safety Project, a community-based survey. <em class="emphasis">Violence Against Women</em>, 1, 6–31.</span> concluded that “it is more common than not for a woman to have an experience of sexual assault during their lifetime.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s01_p02">These figures apply not just to the general public but also to college students. About 20%–30% of women students in anonymous surveys report being raped or sexually assaulted (including attempts), usually by a male student they knew beforehand (Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000; Gross, Winslett, Roberts, &amp; Gohm, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_080">Fisher, B. S., Cullen, F. T., &amp; Turner, M. G. (2000). <em class="emphasis">The sexual victimization of college women</em>. Washington, DC: National Institute of Justice and Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice; Gross, A. M., Winslett, A., Roberts, M., &amp; Gohm, C. L. (2006). An examination of sexual violence against college women. <em class="emphasis">Violence Against Women, 12</em>, 288–300.</span> Thus at a campus of 10,000 students of whom 5,000 are women, about 1,000–1,500 will be raped or sexually assaulted over a period of 4 years, or about 10 per week in a 4-year academic calendar.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s01_p03">The public image of rape is of the proverbial stranger attacking a woman in an alleyway. While such rapes do occur, most rapes actually happen between people who know each other. A wide body of research finds that 60%–80% of all rapes and sexual assaults are committed by someone the woman knows, including husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, and ex-boyfriends, and only 20%–35% by strangers (Barkan, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_081">Barkan, S. E. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Criminology: A sociological understanding</em> (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> A woman is thus 2 to 4 times more likely to be raped by someone she knows than by a stranger.</p>

        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Explaining Rape</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02_p01">Sociological explanations of rape fall into cultural and structural categories similar to those presented earlier for sexual harassment. Various “rape myths” in our culture support the absurd notion that women somehow enjoy being raped, want to be raped, or are “asking for it” (Franiuk, Seefelt, &amp; Vandello, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_082">Franiuk, R., Seefelt, J., &amp; Vandello, J. (2008). Prevalence of rape myths in headlines and their effects on attitudes toward rape. <em class="emphasis">Sex Roles, 58</em>(11/12), 790–801. doi:10.1007/s11199-007-9372-4.</span> One of the most famous scenes in movie history occurs in the classic film <em class="emphasis">Gone with the Wind</em>, when Rhett Butler carries a struggling Scarlett O’Hara up the stairs. She is struggling because she does not want to have sex with him. The next scene shows Scarlett waking up the next morning with a satisfied, loving look on her face. The not-so-subtle message is that she enjoyed being raped (or, to be more charitable to the film, was just playing hard to get).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02_p02">A related cultural belief is that women somehow ask or deserve to be raped by the way they dress or behave. If she dresses attractively or walks into a bar by herself, she wants to have sex, and if a rape occurs, well, then, what did she expect? In the award-winning film <em class="emphasis">The Accused</em>, based on a true story, actress Jodie Foster plays a woman who was raped by several men on top of a pool table in a bar. The film recounts how members of the public questioned why she was in the bar by herself if she did not want to have sex and blamed her for being raped.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02_p03">A third cultural belief is that a man who is sexually active with a lot of women is a stud. Although this belief is less common in this day of AIDS and other STDs, it is still with us. A man with multiple sex partners continues to be the source of envy among many of his peers. At a minimum, men are still the ones who have to “make the first move” and then continue making more moves. There is a thin line between being sexually assertive and sexually aggressive (Kassing, Beesley, &amp; Frey, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_083">Kassing, L. R., Beesley, D., &amp; Frey, L. L. (2005). Gender-role conflict, homophobia, age, and education as predictors of male rape myth acceptance. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Mental Health Counseling, 27</em>(4), 311–328.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02_p04">These three cultural beliefs—that women enjoy being forced to have sex, that they ask or deserve to be raped, and that men should be sexually assertive or even aggressive—combine to produce a cultural recipe for rape. Although most men do not rape, the cultural beliefs and myths just described help account for the rapes that do occur. Recognizing this, the contemporary women’s movement began attacking these myths back in the 1970s, and the public is much more conscious of the true nature of rape than a generation ago. That said, much of the public still accepts these cultural beliefs and myths, and prosecutors continue to find it difficult to win jury convictions in rape trials unless the woman who was raped had suffered visible injuries, had not known the man who raped her, and/or was not dressed attractively (Levine, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_084">Levine, K. L. (2006). The intimacy discount: Prosecutorial discretion, privacy, and equality in the statutory rape caseload. <em class="emphasis">Emory Law Journal, 55</em>(4), 691–749.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s02_p05">Structural explanations for rape emphasize the power differences between women and men similar to those outlined earlier for sexual harassment. In societies that are male dominated, rape and other violence against women is a likely outcome, as they allow men to demonstrate and maintain their power over women. Supporting this view, studies of preindustrial societies and of the 50 states of the United States find that rape is more common in societies where women have less economic and political power (Baron &amp; Straus, 1989; Sanday, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_085">Baron, L., &amp; Straus, M. A. (1989). <em class="emphasis">Four theories of rape in American society: A state-level analysis</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Sanday, P. R. (1981). The socio-cultural context of rape: A cross-cultural study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social Issues, 37</em>, 5–27.</span> Poverty is also a predictor of rape: although rape in the United States transcends social class boundaries, it does seem more common among poorer segments of the population than among wealthier segments, as is true for other types of violence (Rand, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_086">Rand, M. R. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Criminal victimization, 2008</em>. Washington, DC: Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.</span> Scholars think the higher rape rates among the poor stem from poor men trying to prove their “masculinity” by taking out their economic frustration on women (Martin, Vieraitis, &amp; Britto, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_087">Martin, K., Vieraitis, L. M., &amp; Britto, S. (2006). Gender equality and women’s absolute status: A test of the feminist models of rape. <em class="emphasis">Violence Against Women, 12</em>(4), 321–339.</span></p>

        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reducing Rape</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s03_p01">In sum, a sociological perspective tells us that cultural myths and economic and gender inequality help lead to rape, and that the rape problem goes far beyond a few psychopathic men who rape women. A sociological perspective thus tells us that our society cannot just stop at doing something about these men. Instead it must make more far-reaching changes by changing people’s beliefs about rape and by making every effort to reduce poverty and to empower women. This last task is especially important, for, as Randall and Haskell (1995, p. 22),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_088">Randall, M., &amp; Haskell, L. (1995). Sexual violence in women’s lives: Findings from the Women’s Safety Project, a community-based survey. <em class="emphasis">Violence Against Women, 1</em>, 6–31.</span> the authors of the Toronto study cited earlier, observed, a sociological perspective on rape “means calling into question the organization of sexual inequality in our society.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s01_s03_p02">Aside from this fundamental change, other remedies, such as additional and better funded rape-crisis centers, would help women who experience rape and sexual assault. Yet even here women of color face an additional barrier. Because the anti-rape movement was begun by white, middle-class feminists, the rape-crisis centers they founded tended to be near where they live, such as college campuses, and not in the areas where women of color live, such as inner cities and Native American reservations. This meant that women of color who experienced sexual violence lacked the kinds of help available to their white, middle-class counterparts (Matthews, 1989),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_089">Matthews, N. A. (1989). Surmounting a legacy: The expansion of racial diversity in a local anti-rape movement. <em class="emphasis">Gender &amp; Society, 3</em>, 518–532.</span> and, despite some progress, this is still true today.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Pornography</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02_p01">Back in the 1950s, young boys in the United States would page through <em class="emphasis">National Geographic</em> magazine to peek at photos of native women who were partially nude. Those photos, of course, were not put there to excite boys across the country; instead they were there simply to depict native people in their natural habitat. Another magazine began about the same time that also contained photos of nude women. Its name was <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>, and its photos obviously had a much different purpose: to excite teenage boys and older men alike. Other, more graphic magazines grew in its wake, and today television shows and PG-13 and R-rated movies show more nudity and sex than were ever imaginable in the days when <em class="emphasis">National Geographic</em> was a boy’s secret pleasure. Beyond these movies and television shows, a powerful pornography industry now exists on the Internet, in porn stores, and elsewhere. Although <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> quickly became very controversial, it is now considered tame compared to what else is available.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02_p02">If things as different as <em class="emphasis">National Geographic</em>, <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>, R-rated movies, and hard-core pornography show nudity and can be sexually arousing, what, then, should be considered pornography? Are at least some of the tamer pictures in <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> really that different from the great paintings in art history that depict nude women? This question is not necessarily meant to defend <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>; rather it is meant to stimulate your thinking over what exactly is and is not pornography and over what, if anything, our society can and should do about it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02_p03">Many people obviously oppose pornography, but two very different groups have been especially outspoken over the years. One of these groups, religious moralists, condemns pornography as a violation of religious values and as an offense to society’s moral order. The other group, feminists, condemns pornography for its sexual objectification of women and especially condemns the hard-core pornography that glorifies horrible sexual violence against women. Many feminists also charge that pornography promotes rape by reinforcing the cultural myths discussed earlier. As one writer put it in a famous phrase some 30 years ago, “Pornography is the theory, and rape the practice” (Morgan, 1980, p. 139).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_090">Morgan, R. (1980). Theory and practice: Pornography and rape. In L. Lederer (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Take back the night</em> (pp. 134–140). New York, NY: William Morrow.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02_p04">This charge raises an important question: to what extent does pornography cause rape or other violence against women? The fairest answer might be that we do not really know. Many studies do conclude that pornography indeed causes rape. For example, male students who watch violent pornography in experiments later exhibit more hostile attitudes toward women than those watching consensual sex or nonsexual interaction. However, it remains unclear whether viewing pornography has a longer-term effect that lasts beyond the laboratory setting, and scholars and other observers continue to disagree over pornography’s effects on the rape rate (Ferguson &amp; Hartley, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_091">Ferguson, C. J., &amp; Hartley, R. D. (2009). The pleasure is momentary…the expense damnable? The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault. <em class="emphasis">Aggression &amp; Violent Behavior, 14</em>(5), 323–329. doi:10.1016/j.avb.2009.04.008</span> Even if pornography does cause rape, efforts to stop it run smack into the issue of censorship. In a free society, civil liberties advocates say, we must proceed very cautiously. Once we ban some forms of pornography, they ask, where do we stop (Strossen, 2000)?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn11_092">Strossen, N. (2000). <em class="emphasis">Defending pornography: Free speech, sex, and the fight for women’s rights</em>. New York, NY: New York University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch11_s04_s02_p05">This issue aside, much of what we call pornography still degrades women by depicting them as objects that exist for men’s sexual pleasure and by portraying them as legitimate targets of men’s sexual violence. These images should be troubling for any society that values gender equality. The extent of pornography in the United States may, for better or worse, reflect our historical commitment to freedom of speech, but it may also reflect our lack of commitment to full equality between women and men. Even if, as we have seen, the survey evidence shows growing disapproval of traditional gender roles, the persistence of pornography shows that our society has a long way to go toward viewing women as equally human as men.</p>
