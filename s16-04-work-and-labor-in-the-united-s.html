    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_p01">The history of work and labor in the United States reflects the change, discussed earlier, in economies from agricultural to industrial to postindustrial. From the time the colonies began in the 1600s until well into the 19th century, the United States was primarily an agricultural society, as people worked on their own farms, and the family was the major unit of economic production. With the advent of industrialization came machines and factories, and the secondary, manufacturing sector became dominant. In the decades after the Civil War, the Industrial Revolution transformed the nation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Workers and Management After Industrialization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s01_p01">One of the most important developments accompanying industrialization was the rise of labor unions and their conflict with management over wages and working conditions (Dubofsky &amp; Dulles, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_015">Dubofsky, M., &amp; Dulles, F. R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Labor in America: A history</em> (8th ed.). Wheeling, IL: Harlan Davidson.</span> The pay that workers received was quite low, and the conditions in which they worked were often miserable. The typical employee worked at least 10 hours a day for 6 or 7 days a week, with almost no overtime pay and no paid vacations or holidays. To improve wages and working conditions, many labor unions were founded after the Civil War, only to meet determined opposition from companies, the government, and the courts. Companies told each other which workers were suspected of being union members, and these workers were then prevented from getting jobs. Strikers were often arrested for violating laws prohibiting strikes. When juries began finding them not guilty, employers turned to asking judges for injunctions that prohibited strikes. Workers who then went on strike were held in contempt of court by the judge as juries were kept out of the process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s01_p02">Many strikes became violent, as companies brought in armed guards, state troopers, and strikebreakers to put down the strikes. Workers themselves rioted to protest their low wages and abject working conditions. Summarizing this period, two labor historians note that the United States “has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world” (Taft &amp; Ross, 1990, p. 174).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_016">Taft, P., &amp; Ross, P. (1990). American labor violence: Its causes, character, and outcome. In N. A. Weiner, M. A. Zahn, &amp; R. J. Sagi (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Violence: Patterns, causes, public policy</em> (pp. 174–186). San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.</span> During an 1897 coal-mining strike in Pennsylvania, for example, 18 miners were killed and 40 wounded after being shot in the back by a sheriff’s deputies. Several years later, company guards and state troops in Ludlow, Colorado, opened fire on mining families as they fled from a tent city that the guards and troops had set on fire. Their bullets killed more than two dozen people, including 13 children (McGovern &amp; Guttridge, 1972).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_017">McGovern, G. S., &amp; Guttridge, L. F.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s01_p03">Labor strife reached a peak during the Great Depression, as masses of people blamed business leaders for their economic plight. Huge sit-ins and other labor protests occurred in Detroit at auto plants. In response the Congress passed several laws that gave workers a minimum wage, the right to join unions, a maximum-hour workweek, and other rights that Americans now take for granted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s01_p04">Today labor unions have lost some of their influence, especially as postindustrialization has supplanted the industrial economy and as the United States has lost much of its manufacturing base. Four decades ago, about one-fourth of all private-sector nonagricultural workers belonged to labor unions. By 1985 this figure had dropped to 14.6%, and today it stands at less than 8% (Hirsch &amp; Macpherson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_018">Hirsch, B., &amp; Macpherson, D. (2009). Union membership and coverage database from the CPS. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://unionstats.com">http://unionstats.com</a></span> In response, labor unions have ramped up their efforts to increase their membership, only to find that U.S. labor laws are filled with loopholes that allow companies to prevent their workers from forming a union. For example, after a company’s workers vote to join a union, companies can appeal the vote, and it can take several years for courts to order the company to recognize the union. In the meantime, the low wages, the working conditions, and other factors that motivated workers to want to join a union are allowed to continue.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Recent Trends in Jobs and Wages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Recall that the United States has joined other industrial nations in moving into postindustrial economies. If physical prowess and skill with one’s hands were prerequisites for many industrial jobs, mental prowess and communication skills are prerequisites for postindustrial jobs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p02">This move to a postindustrial economy has been a mixed blessing for many Americans. The information age has obvious benefits too numerous to mention, but there has also been a cost to the many workers whom postindustrialization and the globalization of the economy have left behind. Since the 1980s many manufacturing companies moved their plants from U.S. cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere, a problem called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital flight</a><span class="glossdef">The moving of manufacturing companies from U.S. cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere.</span></span>. This shift has helped fuel a loss of more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs in the United States (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_019">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press [An imprint of Cornell University Press].</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p03">A related problem is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">The hiring by U.S. companies of overseas workers for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do.</span></span>, in which U.S. companies hire workers overseas for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do. China, India, and the Philippines, which have skilled workforces relatively fluent in English, are the primary nations to which U.S. companies outsource their work. At least 4 million jobs are estimated to have been transferred to these nations from the United States and other Western countries (Thomas, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_020">Thomas, M. (2009, July 16). Outsourcing statistics: What figures will tell you. <em class="emphasis">EzineArticles</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Outsourcing-Statistics---What-Figures-Will-Tell-You&amp;id=2621948">http://ezinearticles.com/?Outsourcing-Statistics---What-Figures-Will-Tell-You&amp;id=2621948</a></span> Many call centers employ workers in India, and when you call up a computer company or some other business for technical help, you might very well talk with an Indian. Because these call centers have cost Americans jobs and also because Americans and Indians often have trouble understanding each other’s accents, outsourcing has been very controversial in the decade since it became popular.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p04">All these problems reflect a more general shift in the United States from goods-producing jobs to service jobs. Although some of these service jobs, such as many in the financial and computer industries, are high paying, many are in low-wage occupations, such as restaurant and clerical work, that pay less than the goods-producing jobs they replaced. Partly as a result, the average hourly wage (in 2007 dollars) in the United States for workers (excluding managers and supervisors) rose only from $16.88 in 1979 to $17.42 in 2007. This change represented an increase of just 0.1% per year during that three-decade span (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_021">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press [An imprint of Cornell University Press].</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p05">These wage figures mask an important gender difference. Men’s median hourly wages dropped (in 2007 dollars) by 4.4% from 1979 to 2007, while women’s wages rose by 24.4% (while still remaining $3.11 less per hour than men’s wages in 2007) (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_022">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press [An imprint of Cornell University Press].</span> Although, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch11#barkan-ch11">Chapter 11 "Gender and Gender Inequality"</a>, women have been catching up to men in wages, some of this catching up is due to the decline in male wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s02_p06">Wage changes in recent years also depend on what social class someone is in. While the average compensation of chief executive officers (CEOs) of large corporations grew by 167% from 1989 to 2007, the average compensation of the typical worker grew by only 10%. Another way of understanding this disparity is perhaps more striking. In 1965, CEOs earned 24 times more than the typical worker; in 2007 they earned 275 times more than the typical worker (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_023">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Unemployment</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_p01">Unemployment is a fact of life. There will always be people laid off or fired, who voluntarily quit their jobs, or who just graduated school and are still looking for work. But most unemployed people are involuntarily unemployed, and for them the financial and psychological consequences can be devastating, as we saw at the beginning of this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_p02">Unemployment rates rise and fall with the economy, and the national unemployment rate was as high as 10.2% in October 2009 amid the Great Recession that began almost two years earlier; it was still 9.8% in November 2010, amounting to some 15.1 million people. But whether unemployment is high or low, it always varies by race and ethnicity, with African American and Latino unemployment rates higher than the white rate (see <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 13.3 "Race, Ethnicity, and Unemployment Rate, June 2010"</a>). Unemployment is also higher for younger people than for older people. In June 2010, 25.7% of all teenagers in the labor force (aged 16–19) were unemployed, a figure almost three times higher than that for adults. The unemployment rate for African Americans in this age group was a very high 39.9%, considerably greater than the 23.2% figure for whites in this age group (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_026">Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Underemployment includes unemployed and also two other types of people: (a) those who are working part time but who want to work full time and (b) those who have stopped looking for work because they have not been able to find a job. Many economists think that underemployment provides a more accurate measure than unemployment of the number of people with employment problems. For example, in June 2010, when the unemployment rate was 9.5% and 14.6 million people were officially unemployed, the underemployment rate was 16.5%, equal to more than 25 million people. Reflecting the racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment, 23.2% of Latino workers and 23.5% of African American workers were underemployed, compared to only 13.8% of white workers (Economic Policy Institute, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_027">Economic Policy Institute. (2010). Economy track. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economytrack.org/underemployment.php">http://www.economytrack.org/underemployment.php</a></span> Reflecting on the great amount of underemployment during the Great Recession, one economist commented, “When you combine the long-term unemployed with those who are dropping out and those who are working part time because they can’t find anything else, it is just far beyond anything we’ve seen in the job market since the 1930s” (Herbert 2010, p. A25).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_028">Herbert, B. (2010, August 10). The horror show. <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, p. A25.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_p04">We have just seen that unemployment rises when the economy falters and that race and ethnicity affect the probability of being unemployed. These two facts provide evidence supporting the <em class="emphasis">sociological imagination</em>. As C. Wright Mills (1959)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_029">Mills, C. W. (1959). <em class="emphasis">The sociological imagination</em>. London, England: Oxford University Press.</span> emphasized in his original discussion of this concept, unemployment is best viewed more as a public issue than as a personal trouble. When so many people are unemployed during an economic recession and when there is such striking evidence of higher unemployment rates among the persons of color who have the least opportunity for the education and training needed to obtain and keep a job, it is evident that high unemployment rates reflect a public issue rather than just a collection of public troubles.</p>

In striking evidence of racial discrimination in hiring, African American applicants <em class="emphasis">without</em> a criminal record were hired at the same low rate as white applicants <em class="emphasis">with</em> a criminal record. Pager and sociologists Bruce Western and Bart Bonikowski also investigated racial discrimination in another field experiment in New York City (Pager, Bonikowski, &amp; Western, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_031">Pager, D., Bonikowski, B., &amp; Western, B.

Almost one-third (31%) of white testers received a call back or job offer, compared to only 25.2% of Latino testers and 15.2% of African American testers.

                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_p10">As these studies indicate, research by sociologists and other social scientists reveals that race and ethnicity continue to make a difference in employment prospects for Americans. This body of research reveals clear evidence of discrimination, conscious or unconscious, in hiring and also of racial/ethnic differences in access to the informal networks that are often so important for hiring. By uncovering this evidence, these studies underscore the need to address discrimination, access to informal networks, and other factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in employment. For this reason, sociology is again making a difference.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s03_s01_s01_p01">Although the news article that began this chapter gave us a heartrending account of a woman experiencing long-term unemployment, survey data also provide harsh evidence of the social and psychological effects of being unemployed. In July 2010, the Pew Research Center issued a report based on a survey of 810 adults who were currently unemployed or had been unemployed since the Great Recession began in December 2007 and 1,093 people who had never been unemployed during the recession (Morin &amp; Kochhar, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_034">Morin, R. and Kochhar, R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Lost income, lost friends—and loss of self-respect: The impact of long-term unemployment</em>. Washington, DC: Pew Research Center.</span> The report’s title, <em class="emphasis">Lost Income, Lost Friends—and Loss of Self-Respect</em>, summarized its major findings. Of those who had been unemployed for at least 6 months (<em class="emphasis">long-term unemployment</em>), 44% said that the recession had caused “major changes” in their lives, versus only 20% of those who had never been unemployed. More than half of the long-term unemployed said their family income had declined, and more than 40% said that their family relations had been strained and that they had lost contact with close friends. In another finding, 38% said they had “lost some self-respect” from being unemployed. One-third said they were finding it difficult to pay their rent or mortage, compared to only 16% of those who had never been unemployed during the recession. Half had borrowed money from family or friends to pay bills, versus only 18% of the never unemployed. Of all the people who had been unemployed, almost half had experienced sleep difficulties, and 5% had experienced drug or alcohol problems. All these numbers paint a distressing picture of the social and psychological impact of unemployment during the Great Recession that began in late 2007.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Job Satisfaction and Alienation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s04_p01">Recall that Karl Marx thought that job alienation was a major problem in industrial societies. Following up on his concern, social scientists have tried to determine the extent of worker alienation and job satisfaction, as well as the correlates of these two attitudes (Bockerman &amp; Ilmakunnas, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_035">Bockerman, P., &amp; Ilmakunnas, P. (2009). Job disamenities, job satisfaction, quit intentions, and actual separations: Putting the pieces together. <em class="emphasis">Industrial Relations, 48</em>(1), 73–96.</span> They generally find that American workers like their jobs much more than Marx anticipated, but also that the extent to which they like their jobs depends on the income their jobs bring, the degree of autonomy they enjoy in their jobs, and other factors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s04_p02">One way of measuring job satisfaction is simply to ask people, “On the whole, how satisfied are you with the work you do?” The General Social Survey uses precisely this question, and 85.8% of respondents (2008 data) say they are satisfied with their jobs, with only 14.1% saying they are dissatisfied. This latter figure is probably lower than Marx would have predicted for a capitalist society like the United States.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s04_p03">One possible reason for the low amount of job dissatisfaction, and one that Marx did not foresee, is that workers develop friendships in their workplace (McGuire, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_036">McGuire, G. M. (2007). Intimate work: A typology of the social support that workers provide to their network members. <em class="emphasis">Work and Occupations, 34</em>, 125–147.</span> Coworkers discuss all kinds of topics with each other, including personal matters, sports, and political affairs, and they often will invite other coworkers over to their homes or go out with them to a movie or a restaurant. Such friendships can lead workers to like their jobs more than they otherwise would and help overcome the alienation they would feel without the friendships. Such coworker friendships are quite common, as research finds that about half of all workers have at least one close friend who is a coworker (Marks, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_037">Marks, S.

Whichever form it takes, employee theft is so common that is has been called a “widespread, pervasive, and costly form of crime” (Langton, Piquero, &amp; Hollinger, 2006, p. 539).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_038">Langton, L., Piquero, N. L., &amp; Hollinger, R. (2006).

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s01_p02">Employee theft occurs for many reasons, but a common reason is worker dissatisfaction with various aspects of their job. They may think their wages or salaries are too low, they may feel they have been treated unfairly by their employer, and so forth. As the estimates of the amount of employee theft suggest, this form of theft is not condemned by many people, and, indeed, many workplaces have informal norms that approve of certain forms of theft—for example, it is okay to steal inexpensive objects such as (depending on the workplace) utensils, food, pencils and pens, or toilet paper. Not surprisingly, embezzlement is often more costly to an employer than pilferage; although it can involve just a few dollars from a cash register, it can also involve hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars acquired through more sophisticated means. In an example of a very costly embezzlement, the head cashier at the University of California, San Francisco, received a 7-year prison term for embezzling more than $4 million (Chiang, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_040">Chiang, H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s01_p03">When we think of employee theft, we probably usually think of theft by blue-collar or lower white-collar employees. However, physicians, attorneys, and other professionals also steal from their patients/clients or from the government, even if their form of theft is often much more complex and sophisticated than what the term “employee theft” may usually imply. Attorneys may bill their clients for work that was never done, and physicians may bill Medicare or private insurance for patients they never saw or for procedures that were never performed. We call this form of “employee” theft <strong class="emphasis bold">professional fraud</strong>. Fraud by physicians and other health-care professionals (including nursing homes and medical testing laboratories) is thought to amount to $100 billion every year (Rosoff, Pontell, &amp; Tillman, 2010),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_041">Rosoff, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s02_p01">In August 2010, a disgruntled employee went on a shooting rampage inside a beer distributor warehouse in Manchester, Connecticut, killing eight people before shooting himself. He had just been told he would be fired or forced to resign after being caught stealing beer and began the shootings at the end of a disciplinary hearing (Rivera &amp; Haughney, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_042">Rivera, R. and Haughney, C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s02_p02">Many people die or are injured by acts of violence at their workplaces every year in the United States. In 2008, 517 people were slain at their workplaces, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As disturbing as this number was, it represented a sharp drop from the numbers that prevailed a decade earlier, when 1,080 workplace homicides occurred in 1994. From 2003 through 2008, an average of 497 workplace homicides occurred every year (Needleman, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_043">Needleman, S. E. (2010, August 10).

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s02_p03">In terms of who is involved and the reasons for their involvement, three kinds of workplace homicides are the most common. The first and by far the most common type is homicide as the result of robbery. This category includes the many store clerks, gas station attendants, taxi drivers, and other employees who are slain during a robbery, as well as police who are killed as they try to stop a robbery or apprehend the offender. The second category is homicide committed as an act of domestic violence; in this type, the offender, almost always a man, seeks out his wife or girlfriend (or ex-wife or ex-girlfriend) at her workplace and kills her. The third category involves disgruntled workers, such as the one at the Connecticut beer distributor just discussed, who kill one or more people at their workplace whom they blame for problems the killers have been having. Although this type of homicide is the type that the phrase “workplace violence” or “workplace killings” usually brings to mind, it is actually the least common of the three types listed here (Fox, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_044">Fox, J. A. (2010, August 5). Workplace homicide: What is the risk? [Web log post].

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch13_s04_s05_s02_p04">As noted, workplace violence was more common during the 1990s than today, reflecting a general drop in U.S. violence since that decade. National survey evidence indicates that an average of about 1.7 million acts of violence occurred every year in the workplace during the 1990s: 900 homicides, 70,000 robberies, 1.6 million aggravated and simple assaults, and more than 36,000 rapes and sexual assaults (Duhart, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn13_045">Duhart, D.
