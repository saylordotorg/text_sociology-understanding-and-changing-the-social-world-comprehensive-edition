    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_p01">Culture was defined earlier as the symbols, language, beliefs, values, and artifacts that are part of any society. As this definition suggests, there are two basic components of culture: ideas and symbols on the one hand and artifacts (material objects) on the other. The first type, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonmaterial culture</a><span class="glossdef">The symbols, language, norms, and values that constitute a major part of a society’s culture.</span></span>, includes the values, beliefs, symbols, and language that define a society. The second type, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">material culture</a><span class="glossdef">An element of culture consisting of society’s material objects, or artifacts.</span></span>, includes all the society’s physical objects, such as its tools and technology, clothing, eating utensils, and means of transportation. These elements of culture are discussed next.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Symbols</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01_p01">Every culture is filled with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">symbols</a><span class="glossdef">Things that stand for something else and that often evoke various reactions and emotions.</span></span>, or things that stand for something else and that often evoke various reactions and emotions. Some symbols are actually types of nonverbal communication, while other symbols are in fact material objects. As the symbolic interactionist perspective discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch01#barkan-ch01">Chapter 1 "Sociology and the Sociological Perspective"</a> emphasizes, shared symbols make social interaction possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01_p02">Let’s look at nonverbal symbols first. A common one is shaking hands, which is done in some societies but not in others. It commonly conveys friendship and is used as a sign of both greeting and departure. Probably all societies have nonverbal symbols we call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gestures</a><span class="glossdef">Movements of the hands, arms, head, and other parts of the body that are meant to convey ideas or emotions nonverbally.</span></span>, movements of the hands, arms, or other parts of the body that are meant to convey certain ideas or emotions. However, the same gesture can mean one thing in one society and something quite different in another society (Axtell, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_011">Axtell, R. E. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Gestures: The do’s and taboos of body language around the world</em>. New York, NY: Wiley.</span> In the United States, for example, if we nod our head up and down, we mean yes, and if we shake it back and forth, we mean no. In Bulgaria, however, nodding means no, while shaking our head back and forth means yes! In the United States, if we make an “O” by putting our thumb and forefinger together, we mean “OK,” but the same gesture in certain parts of Europe signifies an obscenity. “Thumbs up” in the United States means “great” or “wonderful,” but in Australia it means the same thing as extending the middle finger in the United States. Certain parts of the Middle East and Asia would be offended if they saw you using your left hand to eat, because they use their left hand for bathroom hygiene.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01_p03">Some of our most important symbols are objects. Here the U.S. flag is a prime example. For most Americans, the flag is not just a piece of cloth with red and white stripes and white stars against a field of blue. Instead, it is a symbol of freedom, democracy, and other American values and, accordingly, inspires pride and patriotism. During the Vietnam War, however, the flag became to many Americans a symbol of war and imperialism. Some burned the flag in protest, prompting angry attacks by bystanders and negative coverage by the news media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Other objects have symbolic value for religious reasons. Three of the most familiar religious symbols in many nations are the cross, the Star of David, and the crescent moon, which are widely understood to represent Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, respectively. Whereas many cultures attach no religious significance to these shapes, for many people across the world they evoke very strong feelings of religious faith. Recognizing this, hate groups have often desecrated these symbols.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s01_p05">As these examples indicate, shared symbols, both nonverbal communication and tangible objects, are an important part of any culture but also can lead to misunderstandings and even hostility. These problems underscore the significance of symbols for social interaction and meaning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Language</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p01">Perhaps our most important set of symbols is language. In English, the word <em class="emphasis">chair</em> means something we sit on. In Spanish, the word <em class="emphasis">silla</em> means the same thing. As long as we agree how to interpret these words, a shared language and thus society are possible. By the same token, differences in languages can make it quite difficult to communicate. For example, imagine you are in a foreign country where you do not know the language and the country’s citizens do not know yours. Worse yet, you forgot to bring your dictionary that translates their language into yours, and vice versa, and your iPhone battery has died. You become lost. How will you get help? What will you do? Is there any way to communicate your plight?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p02">As this scenario suggests, language is crucial to communication and thus to any society’s culture. Children learn language from their culture just as they learn about shaking hands, about gestures, and about the significance of the flag and other symbols. Humans have a capacity for language that no other animal species possesses. Our capacity for language in turn helps make our complex culture possible.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p03">In the United States, some people consider a common language so important that they advocate making English the official language of certain cities or states or even the whole country and banning bilingual education in the public schools (Ray, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_012">Ray, S. (2007). Politics over official language in the United States. <em class="emphasis">International Studies, 44,</em> 235–252.</span> Critics acknowledge the importance of English but allege that this movement smacks of anti-immigrant prejudice and would help destroy ethnic subcultures. In 2009, voters in Nashville, Tennessee, rejected a proposal that would have made English the city’s official language and required all city workers to speak in English rather than their native language (R. Brown, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_013">Brown, R. (2009, January 24). Nashville voters reject a proposal for English-only. <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, p. A12.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Language, of course, can be spoken or written. One of the most important developments in the evolution of society was the creation of written language. Some of the preindustrial societies that anthropologists have studied have written language, while others do not, and in the remaining societies the “written” language consists mainly of pictures, not words. <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.1 "The Presence of Written Language (Percentage of Societies)"</a> illustrates this variation with data from 186 preindustrial societies called the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), a famous data set compiled several decades ago by anthropologist George Murdock and colleagues from information that had been gathered on hundreds of preindustrial societies around the world (Murdock &amp; White, 1969).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_014">Murdock, G. P., &amp; White, D. R. (1969). Standard cross-cultural sample. <em class="emphasis">Ethnology, 8,</em> 329–369.</span> In <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.1 "The Presence of Written Language (Percentage of Societies)"</a>, we see that only about one-fourth of the SCCS societies have a written language, while about equal proportions have no language at all or only pictures.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p05">To what extent does language influence how we think and how we perceive the social and physical worlds? The famous but controversial <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">The view that language influences the thoughts and perceptions of people in a society.</span></span>, named after two linguistic anthropologists, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, argues that people cannot easily understand concepts and objects unless their language contains words for these items (Whorf, 1956).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_015">Whorf, B. (1956). <em class="emphasis">Language, thought and reality</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span> Language thus influences how we understand the world around us. For example, people in a country such as the United States that has many terms for different types of kisses (e.g. buss, peck, smack, smooch, and soul) are better able to appreciate these different types than people in a country such as Japan, which, as we saw earlier, only fairly recently developed the word <em class="emphasis">kissu</em> for kiss.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p06">Another illustration of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is seen in sexist language, in which the use of male nouns and pronouns shapes how we think about the world (Miles, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_016">Miles, S. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Language and sexism</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span> In older children’s books, words like fire<em class="emphasis">man</em> and mail<em class="emphasis">man</em> are common, along with pictures of men in these jobs, and critics say they send a message to children that these are male jobs, not female jobs. If a teacher tells a second-grade class, “Every student should put his books under his desk,” the teacher obviously means students of both sexes but may be sending a subtle message that boys matter more than girls. For these reasons, several guidebooks promote the use of nonsexist language (Maggio, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_017">Maggio, R. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The dictionary of bias-free usage: A guide to nondiscriminatory language</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p07">The use of racist language also illustrates the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. An old saying goes, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.” That may be true in theory but not in reality. Names can hurt, especially names that are racial slurs, which African Americans growing up before the era of the civil rights movement routinely heard. According to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the use of these words would have affected how whites perceived African Americans. More generally, the use of racist terms may reinforce racial prejudice and racial stereotypes.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Overcoming Cultural and Ethnic Differences</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p08">People from many different racial and ethnic backgrounds live in large countries such as the United States. Because of cultural differences and various prejudices, it can be difficult for individuals from one background to interact with individuals from another background. Fortunately, a line of research, grounded in <em class="emphasis">contact theory</em> and conducted by sociologists and social psychologists, suggests that interaction among individuals from different backgrounds can indeed help overcome tensions arising from their different cultures and any prejudices they may hold. This happens because such contact helps disconfirm stereotypes that people may hold of those from different backgrounds (Dixon, 2006; Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_018">Dixon, J. C. (2006). The ties that bind and those that don’t: Toward reconciling group threat and contact theories of prejudice. <em class="emphasis">Social Forces, 84,</em> 2179–2204; Pettigrew, T.

Rudman (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">On the nature of prejudice: Fifty years after Allport</em> (pp. 262–277). Malden, MA: Blackwell.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p09">Recent studies of college students provide additional evidence that social contact can help overcome cultural differences and prejudices. Because many students are randomly assigned to their roommates when they enter college, interracial roommates provide a “natural” experiment for studying the effects of social interaction on racial prejudice. Studies of such roommates find that whites with black roommates report lowered racial prejudice and greater numbers of interracial friendships with other students (Laar, Levin, Sinclair, &amp; Sidanius, 2005; Shook &amp; Fazio, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_019">Laar, C.

            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s02_p10">It is not easy to overcome cultural differences and prejudices, and studies also find that interracial college roommates often have to face many difficulties in overcoming the cultural differences and prejudices that existed before they started living together (Shook &amp; Fazio, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_020">Shook, N.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Norms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Cultures differ widely in their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">norms</a><span class="glossdef">Socially acceptable ways of behaving.</span></span>, or standards and expectations for behaving. We already saw that the nature of drunken behavior depends on society’s expectations of how people should behave when drunk. Norms of drunken behavior influence how we behave when we drink too much.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p02">Norms are often divided into two types, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formal norms</a><span class="glossdef">Norms that are very important and usually written down; also called laws and mores.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informal norms</a><span class="glossdef">Relatively unimportant norms, often unwritten, that still affect people’s behavior.</span></span>. Formal norms, also called <em class="emphasis">mores</em> (MOOR-ayz) and <em class="emphasis">laws</em>, refer to the standards of behavior considered the most important in any society. Examples in the United States include traffic laws, criminal codes, and, in a college context, student behavior codes addressing such things as cheating and hate speech. Informal norms, also called <em class="emphasis">folkways</em> and <em class="emphasis">customs</em>, refer to standards of behavior that are considered less important but still influence how we behave. Table manners are a common example of informal norms, as are such everyday behaviors as how we interact with a cashier and how we ride in an elevator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p03">Many norms differ dramatically from one culture to the next. Some of the best evidence for cultural variation in norms comes from the study of sexual behavior (Edgerton, 1976).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_021">Edgerton, R. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Deviance: A cross-cultural perspective</em>. Menlo Park, CA: Cummings.</span> Among the Pokot of East Africa, for example, women are expected to enjoy sex, while among the Gusii a few hundred miles away, women who enjoy sex are considered deviant. In Inis Beag, a small island off the coast of Ireland, sex is considered embarrassing and even disgusting; men feel that intercourse drains their strength, while women consider it a burden. Even nudity is considered terrible, and people on Inis Beag keep their clothes on while they bathe. The situation is quite different in Mangaia, a small island in the South Pacific. Here sex is considered very enjoyable, and it is the major subject of songs and stories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p04">While many societies frown on homosexuality, others accept it. Among the Azande of East Africa, for example, young warriors live with each other and are not allowed to marry. During this time, they often have sex with younger boys, and this homosexuality is approved by their culture. Among the Sambia of New Guinea, young males live separately from females and engage in homosexual behavior for at least a decade. It is felt that the boys would be less masculine if they continued to live with their mothers and that the semen of older males helps young boys become strong and fierce (Edgerton, 1976).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_022">Edgerton, R. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Deviance: A cross-cultural perspective</em>. Menlo Park, CA: Cummings.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p05">Other evidence for cultural variation in norms comes from the study of how men and women are expected to behave in various societies. For example, many traditional societies are simple hunting-and-gathering societies. In most of these, men tend to hunt and women tend to gather. Many observers attribute this gender difference to at least two biological differences between the sexes. First, men tend to be bigger and stronger than women and are thus better suited for hunting. Second, women become pregnant and bear children and are less able to hunt. Yet a different pattern emerges in some hunting-and-gathering societies. Among a group of Australian aborigines called the Tiwi and a tribal society in the Philippines called the Agta, both sexes hunt. After becoming pregnant, Agta women continue to hunt for most of their pregnancy and resume hunting after their child is born (Brettell &amp; Sargent, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_023">Brettell, C. B., &amp; Sargent, C. F. (Eds.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Gender in cross-cultural perspective</em> (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_p06">Some of the most interesting norms that differ by culture govern how people stand apart when they talk with each other (Hall &amp; Hall, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_024">Hall, E. T., &amp; Hall, M. R. (2007). The sounds of silence. In J. M. Henslin (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Down to earth sociology: Introductory readings</em> (pp. 109–117). New York, NY: Free Press.</span> In the United States, people who are not intimates usually stand about three to four feet apart when they talk. If someone stands more closely to us, especially if we are of northern European heritage, we feel uncomfortable. Yet people in other countries—especially Italy, France, Spain, and many of the nations of Latin America and the Middle East—would feel uncomfortable if they were standing three to four feet apart. To them, this distance is too great and indicates that the people talking dislike each other. If a U.S. native of British or Scandinavian heritage were talking with a member of one of these societies, they might well have trouble interacting, because at least one of them will be uncomfortable with the physical distance separating them.</p>

As such, rituals both reflect and transmit a culture’s norms and other elements from one generation to the next. Graduation ceremonies in colleges and universities are familiar examples of time-honored rituals. In many societies, rituals help signify one’s gender identity. For example, girls around the world undergo various types of initiation ceremonies to mark their transition to adulthood. Among the Bemba of Zambia, girls undergo a month-long initiation ceremony called the <em class="emphasis">chisungu</em>, in which girls learn songs, dances, and secret terms that only women know (Maybury-Lewis, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_025">Maybury-Lewis, D.

Guilford, CT: Dushkin/McGraw-Hill.</span> In some cultures, special ceremonies also mark a girl’s first menstrual period. Such ceremonies are largely absent in the United States, where a girl’s first period is a private matter. But in other cultures the first period is a cause for celebration involving gifts, music, and food (Hathaway, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_026">Hathaway, N. (1997).

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p02">Boys have their own initiation ceremonies, some of them involving circumcision. That said, the ways in which circumcisions are done and the ceremonies accompanying them differ widely. In the United States, boys who are circumcised usually undergo a quick procedure in the hospital. If their parents are observant Jews, circumcision will be part of a religious ceremony, and a religious figure called a <em class="emphasis">moyel</em> will perform the circumcision. In contrast, circumcision among the Maasai of East Africa is used as a test of manhood. If a boy being circumcised shows signs of fear, he might well be ridiculed (Maybury-Lewis, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_027">Maybury-Lewis, D. (1998). Tribal wisdom. In K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p03">Are rituals more common in traditional societies than in industrial ones such as the United States? Consider the Nacirema, studied by anthropologist Horace Miner more than 50 years ago (Miner, 1956).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_028">Miner, H. (1956). Body ritual among the Nacirema. <em class="emphasis">American Anthropologist, 58,</em> 503–507.</span> In this society, many rituals have been developed to deal with the culture’s fundamental belief that the human body is ugly and in danger of suffering many diseases. Reflecting this belief, every household has at least one shrine in which various rituals are performed to cleanse the body. Often these shrines contain magic potions acquired from medicine men. The Nacirema are especially concerned about diseases of the mouth. Miner writes, “Were it not for the rituals of the mouth, they believe that their teeth would fall out, their gums bleed, their jaws shrink, their friends desert them, and their lovers reject them” (p. 505).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_029">Miner, H. (1956). Body ritual among the Nacirema. <em class="emphasis">American Anthropologist, 58,</em> 503–507.</span> Many Nacirema engage in “mouth-rites” and see a “holy-mouth-man” once or twice yearly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p04">Spell Nacirema backward and you will see that Miner was describing American culture. As his satire suggests, rituals are not limited to preindustrial societies. Instead, they function in many kinds of societies to mark transitions in the life course and to transmit the norms of the culture from one generation to the next.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_p01">Our examples show that different cultures have different norms, even if they share other types of practices and beliefs. It is also true that norms change over time within a given culture. Two obvious examples here are hairstyles and clothing styles. When the Beatles first became popular in the early 1960s, their hair barely covered their ears, but parents of teenagers back then were aghast at how they looked. If anything, clothing styles change even more often than hairstyles. Hemlines go up, hemlines go down. Lapels become wider, lapels become narrower. This color is in, that color is out. Hold on to your out-of-style clothes long enough, and eventually they may well end up back in style.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_p02">A more important topic on which norms have changed is abortion and birth control (Bullough &amp; Bullough, 1977).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_030">Bullough, V. L., &amp; Bullough, B. (1977). <em class="emphasis">Sin, sickness, and sanity: A history of sexual attitudes</em>. New York, NY: New American Library.</span> Despite the controversy surrounding abortion today, it was very common in the ancient world. Much later, medieval theologians generally felt that abortion was not murder if it occurred within the first several weeks after conception. This distinction was eliminated in 1869, when Pope Pius IX declared abortion at any time to be murder. In the United States, abortion was not illegal until 1828, when New York state banned it to protect women from unskilled abortionists, and most other states followed suit by the end of the century. However, the sheer number of unsafe, illegal abortions over the next several decades helped fuel a demand for repeal of abortion laws that in turn helped lead to the <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> Supreme Court decision in 1973 that generally legalized abortion during the first two trimesters.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_p03">Contraception was also practiced in ancient times, only to be opposed by early Christianity. Over the centuries, scientific discoveries of the nature of the reproductive process led to more effective means of contraception and to greater calls for its use, despite legal bans on the distribution of information about contraception. In the early 1900s, Margaret Sanger, an American nurse, spearheaded the growing birth-control movement and helped open a birth-control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916. She and two other women were arrested within 10 days, and Sanger and one other defendant were sentenced to 30 days in jail. Efforts by Sanger and other activists helped to change views on contraception over time, and finally, in 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em class="emphasis">Griswold v. Connecticut</em> that contraception information could not be banned. As this brief summary illustrates, norms about contraception changed dramatically during the last century.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_p04">Other types of cultural beliefs also change over time (<a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_f01">Figure 3.2 "Percentage of People Who Say They Would Vote for a Qualified African American for President"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_f02">Figure 3.3 "Percentage of People Who Agree Women Should Take Care of Running Their Homes"</a>). Since the 1960s, the U.S. public has changed its views about some important racial and gender issues. <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_f01">Figure 3.2 "Percentage of People Who Say They Would Vote for a Qualified African American for President"</a>, taken from several years of the General Social Survey (GSS), shows that the percentage of Americans who would vote for a qualified black person as president rose almost 20 points from the early 1970s to the middle of 1996, when the GSS stopped asking the question. If beliefs about voting for an African American had not changed, Barack Obama would almost certainly not have been elected in 2008. <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s03_s02_f02">Figure 3.3 "Percentage of People Who Agree Women Should Take Care of Running Their Homes"</a>, also taken from several years of the GSS, shows that the percentage saying that women should take care of running their homes and leave running the country to men declined from almost 36% in the early 1970s to only about 15% in 1998, again, when the GSS stopped asking the question. These two figures depict declining racial and gender prejudice in the United States during the past quarter-century.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s01_p01">In the United States, of course, the situation is quite different. The American culture extols the rights of the individual and promotes competition in the business and sports worlds and in other areas of life. Lawsuits over the most frivolous of issues are quite common and even expected. Phrases like “Look out for number one!” abound. If the Japanese value harmony and group feeling, Americans value competition and individualism. Because the Japanese value harmony, their norms frown on self-assertion in interpersonal relationships and on lawsuits to correct perceived wrongs. Because Americans value and even thrive on competition, our norms promote assertion in relationships and certainly promote the use of the law to address all kinds of problems.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s01_p03">The Japanese value system is a bit of an anomaly, because Japan is an industrial nation with very traditional influences. Its emphasis on group harmony and community is more usually thought of as a value found in traditional societies, while the U.S. emphasis on individuality is more usually thought of as a value found in industrial cultures. Anthropologist David Maybury-Lewis (1998, p. 8)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_033">Maybury-Lewis, D. (1998). Tribal wisdom. In K. Finsterbusch (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Sociology 98/99</em> (pp. 8–12). Guilford, CT: Dushkin/McGraw-Hill.</span> describes this difference as follows: “The heart of the difference between the modern world and the traditional one is that in traditional societies people are a valuable resource and the interrelations between them are carefully tended; in modern society things are the valuables and people are all too often treated as disposable.” In industrial societies, continues Maybury-Lewis, individualism and the rights of the individual are celebrated and any one person’s obligations to the larger community are weakened. Individual achievement becomes more important than values such as kindness, compassion, and generosity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s01_p04">Other scholars take a less bleak view of industrial society, where they say the spirit of community still lives even as individualism is extolled (Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, &amp; Tipton, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_034">Bellah, R.

Berkeley: University of California Press.</span> In American society, these two simultaneous values sometimes create tension. In Appalachia, for example, people view themselves as rugged individuals who want to control their own fate. At the same time, they have strong ties to families, relatives, and their neighbors. Thus their sense of independence conflicts with their need for dependence on others (Erikson, 1976).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_035">Erikson, K. T.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s02_p01">Another important value in the American culture is the work ethic. By the 19th century, Americans had come to view hard work not just as something that had to be done but as something that was morally good to do (Gini, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_036">Gini, A. (2000). <em class="emphasis">My job, my self: Work and the creation of the modern individual</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s02_p02">Cross-cultural evidence supports the importance of the work ethic in the United States. Using earlier World Values Survey data, <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch03_s02_s04_s02_f01">Figure 3.5 "Percentage of People Who Take a Great Deal of Pride in Their Work"</a> presents the percentage of people in United States and three other nations from different parts of the world—Mexico, Poland, and Japan—who take “a great deal of pride” in their work.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p02">Although the wheel was a great invention, artifacts are much more numerous and complex in industrial societies. Because of technological advances during the past two decades, many such societies today may be said to have a <em class="emphasis">wireless</em> culture, as smartphones, netbooks and laptops, and GPS devices now dominate so much of modern life. The artifacts associated with this culture were unknown a generation ago. Technological development created these artifacts and new language to describe them and the functions they perform. Today’s wireless artifacts in turn help reinforce our own commitment to wireless technology as a way of life, if only because children are now growing up with them, often even before they can read and write.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p03">Sometimes people in one society may find it difficult to understand the artifacts that are an important part of another society’s culture. If a member of a tribal society who had never seen a cell phone, or who had never even used batteries or electricity, were somehow to visit the United States, she or he would obviously have no idea of what a cell phone was or of its importance in almost everything we do these days. Conversely, if we were to visit that person’s society, we might not appreciate the importance of some of its artifacts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p04">In this regard, consider once again India’s cows, discussed in the news article that began this chapter. As the article mentioned, people from India consider cows holy, and they let cows roam the streets of many cities. In a nation where hunger is so rampant, such cow worship is difficult to understand, at least to Americans, because a ready source of meat is being ignored.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p05">Anthropologist Marvin Harris (1974)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn03_037">Harris, M. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Cows, pigs, wars, and witches: The riddles of culture</em>. New York, NY: Vintage Books.</span> advanced a practical explanation for India’s cow worship. Millions of Indians are peasants who rely on their farms for their food and thus their existence. Oxen and water buffalo, not tractors, are the way they plow their fields. If their ox falls sick or dies, farmers may lose their farms. Because, as Harris observes, oxen are made by cows, it thus becomes essential to preserve cows at all costs. In India, cows also act as an essential source of fertilizer, to the tune of 700 million tons of manure annually, about half of which is used for fertilizer and the other half of which is used as fuel for cooking. Cow manure is also mixed with water and used as flooring material over dirt floors in Indian households. For all of these reasons, cow worship is not so puzzling after all, because it helps preserve animals that are very important for India’s economy and other aspects of its way of life.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p06">If Indians exalt cows, many Jews and Muslims feel the opposite about pigs: they refuse to eat any product made from pigs and so obey an injunction from the Old Testament of the Bible and from the Koran. Harris thinks this injunction existed because pig farming in ancient times would have threatened the ecology of the Middle East. Sheep and cattle eat primarily grass, while pigs eat foods that people eat, such as nuts, fruits, and especially grains. In another problem, pigs do not provide milk and are much more difficult to herd than sheep or cattle. Next, pigs do not thrive well in the hot, dry climate in which the people of the Old Testament and Koran lived. Finally, sheep and cattle were a source of food back then because beyond their own meat they provided milk, cheese, and manure, and cattle were also used for plowing. In contrast, pigs would have provided only their own meat. Because sheep and cattle were more “versatile” in all of these ways, and because of the other problems pigs would have posed, it made sense for the eating of pork to be prohibited.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch03_s02_s05_p07">In contrast to Jews and Muslims, at least one society, the Maring of the mountains of New Guinea, is characterized by “pig love.” Here pigs are held in the highest regard. The Maring sleep next to pigs, give them names and talk to them, feed them table scraps, and once or twice every generation have a mass pig sacrifice that is intended to ensure the future health and welfare of Maring society. Harris explains their love of pigs by noting that their climate is ideally suited to raising pigs, which are an important source of meat for the Maring. Because too many pigs would overrun the Maring, their periodic pig sacrifices help keep the pig population to manageable levels. Pig love thus makes as much sense for the Maring as pig hatred did for people in the time of the Old Testament and the Koran.</p>
