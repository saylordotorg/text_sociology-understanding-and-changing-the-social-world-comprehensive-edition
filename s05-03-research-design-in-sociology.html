        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Sociological Research</h2>
        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Surveys</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p01">The survey is the most common method by which sociologists gather their data. The Gallup Poll is perhaps the best-known example of a survey and, like all surveys, gathers its data with the help of a questionnaire that is given to a group of respondents. The Gallup Poll is an example of a survey conducted by a private organization, but it typically includes only a small range of variables. It thus provides a good starting point for research but usually does not include enough variables for a full-fledged sociological study. Sociologists often do their own surveys, as does the government and many organizations in addition to Gallup.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p02">The General Social Survey, described earlier, is an example of a face-to-face survey, in which interviewers meet with respondents to ask them questions. This type of survey can yield a lot of information, because interviewers typically will spend at least an hour asking their questions, and a high <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">response rate</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of a sample that agrees to be included in a study, usually a survey.</span></span> (the percentage of all people in the sample who agree to be interviewed), which is important to be able to generalize the survey’s results to the entire population. On the downside, this type of survey can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p03">Because of these drawbacks, sociologists and other researchers have turned to telephone surveys. Most Gallup Polls are conducted over the telephone. Computers do random-digit dialing, which results in a random sample of all telephone numbers being selected. Although the response rate and the number of questions asked are both lower than in face-to-face surveys (people can just hang up the phone at the outset or let their answering machine take the call), the ease and low expense of telephone surveys are making them increasingly popular.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p04">Mailed surveys, done by mailing questionnaires to respondents, are still used, but not as often as before. Compared with face-to-face surveys, mailed questionnaires are less expensive and time consuming but have lower response rates, because many people simply throw out the questionnaire along with other junk mail.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p05">Whereas mailed surveys are becoming less popular, surveys done over the Internet are becoming more popular, as they can reach many people at very low expense. A major problem with Web surveys is that their results cannot necessarily be generalized to the entire population, because not everyone has access to the Internet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Experiments</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p01">Experiments are the primary form of research in the natural and physical sciences, but in the social sciences they are for the most part found only in psychology. Some sociologists still use experiments, however, and they remain a powerful tool of social research.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p02">The major advantage of experiments is that the researcher can be fairly sure of a cause-and-effect relationship because of the way the experiment is set up. Although many different experimental designs exist, the typical experiment consists of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">experimental group</a><span class="glossdef">In an experiment, the group that experiences the experimental condition.</span></span> and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">control group</a><span class="glossdef">In an experiment, the group that does not experience the experimental condition.</span></span>, with subjects <em class="emphasis">randomly assigned</em> to either group. The researcher makes a change to the experimental group that is not made to the control group. If the two groups differ later in some variable, then it is safe to say that the condition to which the experimental group was subjected was responsible for the difference that resulted.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p03">Most experiments take place in the laboratory, which for psychologists may be a room with a one-way mirror, but some experiments occur in “the field,” or in a natural setting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the early 1980s, sociologists were involved in a much-discussed field experiment sponsored by the federal government. The researchers wanted to see whether arresting men for domestic violence made it less likely that they would commit such violence again. To test this hypothesis, the researchers had police do one of the following after arriving at the scene of a domestic dispute: they either arrested the suspect, separated him from his wife or partner for several hours, or warned him to stop but did not arrest or separate him. The researchers then determined the percentage of men in each group who committed repeated domestic violence during the next 6 months and found that those who were arrested had the lowest rate of recidivism, or repeat offending (Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn02_005">Sherman, L. W., &amp; Berk, R. A. (1984). The specific deterrent effects of arrest for domestic assault. <em class="emphasis">American Sociological Review, 49</em>, 261–272.</span> This finding led many jurisdictions across the United States to adopt a policy of mandatory arrest for domestic violence suspects. However, replications of the Minneapolis experiment in other cities found that arrest sometimes reduced recidivism for domestic violence but also sometimes increased it, depending on which city was being studied and on certain characteristics of the suspects, including whether they were employed at the time of their arrest (Sherman, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn02_006">Sherman, L W. (1992). <em class="emphasis">Policing domestic violence: Experiments and dilemmas</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">As the Minneapolis study suggests, perhaps the most important problem with experiments is that their results are not generalizable beyond the specific subjects studied. The subjects in most psychology experiments, for example, are college students, who are not typical of average Americans: they are younger, more educated, and more likely to be middle class. Despite this problem, experiments in psychology and other social sciences have given us very valuable insights into the sources of attitudes and behavior.</p>

        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Observational Studies and Intensive Interviewing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p01">Observational research, also called field research, is a staple of sociology. Sociologists have long gone into the field to observe people and social settings, and the result has been many rich descriptions and analyses of behavior in juvenile gangs, bars, urban street corners, and even whole communities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p02">Observational studies consist of both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">participant observation</a><span class="glossdef">Field research in which the researcher is an active member of the group or setting being observed.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonparticipant observation</a><span class="glossdef">Field research in which the researcher merely observes a group or setting.</span></span>. Their names describe how they differ. In participant observation, the researcher is part of the group that she or he is studying. The researcher thus spends time with the group and might even live with them for a while. Several classical sociological studies of this type exist, many of them involving people in urban neighborhoods (Liebow, 1967, 1993; Whyte, 1943).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn02_007">Liebow, E. (1967). <em class="emphasis">Tally’s corner</em>. Boston, MA: Little, Brown; Liebow, E. (1993). <em class="emphasis">Tell them who I am: The lives of homeless women</em>. New York, NY: Free Press; Whyte, W. F. (1943). <em class="emphasis">Street corner society: The social structure of an Italian slum</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> Participant researchers must try not to let their presence influence the attitudes or behavior of the people they are observing. In nonparticipant observation, the researcher observes a group of people but does not otherwise interact with them. If you went to your local shopping mall to observe, say, whether people walking with children looked happier than people without children, you would be engaging in nonparticipant observation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p03">A related type of research design is <em class="emphasis">intensive interviewing</em>. Here a researcher does not necessarily observe a group of people in their natural setting but rather sits down with them individually and interviews them at great length, often for one or two hours or even longer. The researcher typically records the interview and later transcribes it for analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of intensive interviewing are similar to those for observational studies: intensive interviewing provides much information about the subjects being interviewed, but the results of such interviewing cannot necessarily be generalized beyond the subjects.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p04">A classic example of field research is Kai T. Erikson’s <em class="emphasis">Everything in Its Path</em> (1976),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn02_008">Erikson, K. T. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Everything in its path: Destruction of community in the Buffalo Creek flood</em>. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster.</span> a study of the loss of community bonds in the aftermath of a flood in a West Virginia mining community, Buffalo Creek. The flood occurred when an artificial dam composed of mine waste gave way after days of torrential rain. The local mining company had allowed the dam to build up in violation of federal law. When it broke, 132 million gallons of water broke through and destroyed several thousand homes in seconds while killing 125 people. Some 2,500 other people were rendered instantly homeless. Erikson was called in by the lawyers representing the survivors to document the sociological effects of their loss of community, and the book he wrote remains a moving account of how the destruction of the Buffalo Creek way of life profoundly affected the daily lives of its residents.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p05">Similar to experiments, observational studies cannot automatically be generalized to other settings or members of the population. But in many ways they provide a richer account of people’s lives than surveys do, and they remain an important method of sociological research.</p>

        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Existing Data</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p01">Sometimes sociologists do not gather their own data but instead analyze existing data that someone else has gathered. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, gathers data on all kinds of areas relevant to the lives of Americans, and many sociologists analyze census data on such topics as poverty, employment, and illness. Sociologists interested in crime and the legal system may analyze data from court records, while medical sociologists often analyze data from patient records at hospitals. Analysis of existing data such as these is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary data analysis</a><span class="glossdef">The analysis of data from existing records.</span></span>. Its advantage to sociologists is that someone else has already spent the time and money to gather the data. A disadvantage is that the data set being analyzed may not contain data on all the variables in which a sociologist may be interested or may contain data on variables that are not measured in ways the sociologist might prefer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p02">Nonprofit organizations often analyze existing data, usually gathered by government agencies, to get a better understanding of the social issue with which an organization is most concerned. They then use their analysis to help devise effective social policies and strategies for dealing with the issue. The “Learning From Other Societies” box discusses a nonprofit organization in Canada that analyzes existing data for this purpose.</p>

                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p03">In several nations beyond the United States, nonprofit organizations often use social science research, including sociological research, to develop and evaluate various social reform strategies and social policies. Canada is one of these nations.

                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p04">The Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy (CRISP) at the University of New Brunswick is one of these organizations. According to its Web site (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.unb.ca/crisp/index.php">http://www.unb.ca/crisp/index.php</a>), CRISP is “dedicated to conducting policy research aimed at improving the education and care of Canadian children and youth…and supporting low-income countries in their efforts to build research capacity in child development.” To do this, CRISP analyzes data from large data sets, such as the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, and it also evaluates policy efforts at the local, national, and international levels.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p05">A major concern of CRISP has been developmental problems in low-income children and teens. These problems are the focus of a CRISP project called Raising and Leveling the Bar: A Collaborative Research Initiative on Children’s Learning, Behavioral, and Health Outcomes. This project at the time of this writing involved a team of five senior researchers and almost two dozen younger scholars. CRISP notes that Canada may have the most complete data on child development in the world but that much more research with these data needs to be performed to help inform public policy in the area of child development. CRISP’s project aims to use these data to help achieve the following goals, as listed on its Web site: (a) safeguard the healthy development of infants, (b) strengthen early childhood education, (c) improve schools and local communities, (d) reduce socioeconomic segregation and the effects of poverty, and (e) create a family enabling society (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.unb.ca/crisp/rlb.html">http://www.unb.ca/crisp/rlb.html</a>). This project has written many policy briefs, journal articles, and popular press articles to educate varied audiences about what the data on children’s development suggest for child policy in Canada.</p>
