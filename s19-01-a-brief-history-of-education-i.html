As this definition makes clear, education is an important part of socialization. Education is both <em class="emphasis">formal</em> and <em class="emphasis">informal</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Formal education</a><span class="glossdef">Learning that occurs in schools under teachers, principals, and other specially trained professionals.</span></span> is often referred to as <em class="emphasis">schooling</em>, and as this term implies, it occurs in schools under teachers, principals, and other specially trained professionals. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Informal education</a><span class="glossdef">Learning that occurs outside the schools, traditionally in the home.</span></span> may occur almost anywhere, but for young children it has traditionally occurred primarily in the home, with their parents as their instructors. Day care has become an increasingly popular venue in industrial societies for young children’s instruction, and education from the early years of life is thus more formal than it used to be.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch16_s01_p02">Education in early America was hardly formal. During the colonial period, the Puritans in what is now Massachusetts required parents to teach their children to read and also required larger towns to have an elementary school, where children learned reading, writing, and religion. In general, though, schooling was not required in the colonies, and only about 10% of colonial children, usually just the wealthiest, went to school, although others became apprentices (Urban, Jennings, &amp; Wagoner, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn16_002">Urban, W. J., Jennings L., &amp; Wagoner, J. (2008). <em class="emphasis">American education: A history</em> (4th ed.). New York, NY: Routledge.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch16_s01_p03">To help unify the nation after the Revolutionary War, textbooks were written to standardize spelling and pronunciation and to instill patriotism and religious beliefs in students. At the same time, these textbooks included negative stereotypes of Native Americans and certain immigrant groups. The children going to school continued primarily to be those from wealthy families. By the mid-1800s, a call for free, compulsory education had begun, and compulsory education became widespread by the end of the century. This was an important development, as children from all social classes could now receive a free, formal education. Compulsory education was intended to further national unity and to teach immigrants “American” values. It also arose because of industrialization, as an industrial economy demanded reading, writing, and math skills much more than an agricultural economy had.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch16_s01_p04">Free, compulsory education, of course, applied only to primary and secondary schools. Until the mid-1900s, very few people went to college, and those who did typically came from the fairly wealthy families. After World War II, however, college enrollments soared, and today more people are attending college than ever before, even though college attendance is still related to social class, as we shall discuss shortly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch16_s01_p05">At least two themes emerge from this brief history. One is that until very recently in the record of history, formal schooling was restricted to wealthy males. This means that boys who were not white and rich were excluded from formal schooling, as were virtually all girls, whose education was supposed to take place informally at home. Today, as we will see, race, ethnicity, social class, and, to some extent, gender continue to affect both educational achievement and the amount of learning occurring in schools.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch16_s01_p06">Second, although the rise of free, compulsory education was an important development, the reasons for this development trouble some critics (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Cole, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn16_003">Bowles, S., &amp; Gintis, H. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Schooling in capitalist America: Educational reforms and the contradictions of economic life</em>. New York, NY: Basic Books; Cole, M. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Marxism and educational theory: Origins and issues</em>. New York, NY: Routledge.</span> Because compulsory schooling began in part to prevent immigrants’ values from corrupting “American” values, they see its origins as smacking of ethnocentrism. They also criticize its intention to teach workers the skills they needed for the new industrial economy. Because most workers were very poor in this economy, these critics say, compulsory education served the interests of the upper/capitalist class much more than it served the interests of workers. It was good that workers became educated, say the critics, but in the long run their education helped the owners of capital much more than it helped the workers themselves. Whose interests are served by education remains an important question addressed by sociological perspectives on education, to which we now turn.</p>
