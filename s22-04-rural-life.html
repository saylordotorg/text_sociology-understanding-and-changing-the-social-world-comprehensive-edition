        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_p01">Before we leave the topic of cities and urbanization, it is important to note that one-fourth of the U.S. population and more than 40% of the world population continue to live in rural areas. The dual view of cities presented in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch19#barkan-ch19">Chapter 19 "Population and Urbanization"</a>, <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch19_s03#barkan-ch19_s03">Section 19.3 "Urbanization"</a> also applies to rural areas but does so in a sort of mirror image: the advantages of cities are often disadvantages for rural areas, and the disadvantages of cities are often advantages for rural areas.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_p02">On the positive side, and focusing on the United States, rural areas feature much more open space and less crowding. Their violent and property crime rates are much lower than those in large cities, as we have seen. The air is cleaner because there is less traffic and fewer factories and other facilities that emit pollution. At least anecdotally, life in rural areas is thought to be slower-paced, resulting in lower levels of anxiety and a greater sense of relaxation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_p03">On the negative side, rural areas are often poor and lack the services, employment opportunities, and leisure activities that cities have. Teens often complain of boredom, and drug and alcohol use can be high (Johnson et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_046">Johnson, A. O., Mink, M. D., Harun, N., Moore, C. G., Martin, A. B., &amp; Bennett, K. J. (2008). Violence and drug use in rural teens: National prevalence estimates from the 2003 youth risk behavior survey. <em class="emphasis">Journal of School Health, 78</em>(10), 554–561.</span> Public transportation is often lacking, making it difficult for people without motor vehicles, who tend to be low-income, to get to workplaces, stores, and other venues (Brown, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_047">Brown, D. M. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Public transportation on the move in rural America</em>. Washington, DC: Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.</span> Many rural areas in the United States lack high-speed broadband, a necessity in today’s economy. As a result, their economic development is impaired (Whitacre, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_048">Whitacre, B. E. (2010). The diffusion of internet technologies to rural communities: A portrait of broadband supply and demand. <em class="emphasis">American Behavioral Scientist, 53</em>, 1283–1303.</span> Rural areas also face several other challenges, which we now examine.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rural Health and Rural Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s01_p01">As <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch18#barkan-ch18">Chapter 18 "Health and Medicine"</a> noted, rural areas often lack sufficient numbers of health-care professionals and high-quality hospitals and medical clinics. The long distances that people must travel make it even more difficult for individuals with health problems to receive adequate medical care. Partly because of these problems, rural residents are less likely than urban residents to receive preventive services such as physical examinations; screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer; and vaccinations for various illnesses and diseases. These problems help explain why rural residents are more likely than urban residents to report being in only fair or poor health in government surveys (Bennett, Olatosi, &amp; Probst, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_049">Bennett, K. J., Olatosi, B., &amp; Probst, J. C. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Health disparities: A rural-urban chartbook</em>. Columbia: South Carolina Rural Health Research Center.</span> Compared to nonrural areas, rural areas also have an “aging population,” or a greater percentage of adults aged 65 and older. This fact adds to the health-care problems that rural areas must address.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s01_p02">In the area of education, rural schools often face hurdles that urban and suburban schools do not encounter (Center for Rural Policy and Development, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_050">Center for Rural Policy and Development. (2009). <em class="emphasis">A region apart: A look at challenges and strategies for rural K–12 schools</em>. Saint Peter, MN: Author.</span> First, because rural areas have been losing population, they have been experiencing declining school enrollment and school closings. Second, rural populations are generally older than urban populations and have a greater percentage of retired adults. Therefore, rural areas’ per-capita income and sales tax revenue is lower than that for urban and suburban areas, and this lower revenue makes the funding of public schools more challenging. Third, rural families live relatively far from the public schools, and the schools are relatively far from each other. As a result, rural school districts have considerable expenses for transporting children to and from school, after-school athletic events, and other activities. Finally, it is often difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in rural areas, and this problem has forced some rural school districts to offer hiring bonuses or housing assistance to staff their schools.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rural Poverty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s02_p01">Although, as we have seen, many U.S. cities have high poverty rates, more than 7 million rural residents are officially poor, and poverty in rural areas tends to be more severe and persistent than in nonrural areas. Rural poverty stems from several factors, including the out-migration of young, highly skilled workers; the lack of industrial jobs that typically have been higher paying than agricultural jobs; and limited opportunities for the high-paying jobs of the information age.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s02_p02">Compounding the general problem of poverty, rural areas are also more likely than nonrural areas to lack human service programs to help the poor, disabled, elderly, and other people in need of aid (National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_051">National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. (2008). <em class="emphasis">The 2008 report to the secretary: Rural health and human services issues</em>. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</span> Because rural towns are so small, they often cannot afford services such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and Meals on Wheels, and thus must rely on services located in other towns. Yet rural towns are often far from each other, making it difficult and expensive for rural residents to obtain the services they need. For example, a Meals on Wheels program in an urban area may travel just a few miles and serve dozens of people, while it may travel more than 100 miles in a rural area and serve only a few people. Adding to this problem is the strong sense in many rural areas that individuals should be strong enough to fend for themselves and not accept government help. Even when services are available, some people who need them decline to take advantage of them because of pride and shame.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Domestic Violence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p01">In a problem that only recently has been recognized, rural women who experience domestic violence find it especially difficult to get help and/or to leave their abusers. Rural police may be unenlightened about domestic violence and may even know the abuser; for either reason, they may not consider his violence a crime. Battered women’s shelters are also much less common in rural areas than in cities, and battered women in rural areas often lack neighbors and friends to whom they can turn for support. For all of these reasons, rural women who experience domestic violence face a problem that has been called “dangerous exits” (DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn19_052">DeKeseredy, W. S., &amp; Schwartz, M. D. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Dangerous exits: Escaping abusive relationships in rural America</em>. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.</span></p>

                <li>Like cities, rural areas also have their advantages and disadvantages. They can be beautiful, relaxing places in which to live, but they also lack many of the cultural advantages and other amenities that cities feature.</li>
                <li>Rural areas are characterized by sparse populations and long distances that people must travel. These conditions make it difficult to provide adequate public transportation and various kinds of human services. The poverty of many rural areas aggravates these problems.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Addressing Population and Urbanization Issues: What Sociology Suggests</h3>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p02">The topics of population and urbanization raise many issues within the United States and also across the globe for which a sociological perspective is very relevant. We address of few of these issues here.</p>
            <p class="simpara">Population Issues</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p03">Perhaps the most serious population issue is world hunger. Both across the globe and within the United States, children and adults go hungry every day, and millions starve in the poorest nations in Africa and Asia. As the “Sociology Making a Difference” box in this chapter discussed, sociological research indicates that it is mistaken to blame world hunger on a scarcity of food. Instead, this body of research attributes world hunger to various inequalities in access to, and in the distribution of, what is actually a sufficient amount of food to feed the world’s people. To effectively reduce world hunger, inequalities across the globe and within the United States based on income, ethnicity, and gender must be addressed; some ways of doing so have been offered in previous chapters.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p04">Population growth in poor nations has slowed but remains a significant problem. Their poverty, low educational levels, and rural settings all contribute to high birth rates. More effective contraception is needed to reduce their population growth, and the United Nations and other international bodies must bolster their efforts, with the aid of increased funding from rich nations, to provide contraception to poor nations. But contraceptive efforts will not be sufficient by themselves. Rather, it is also necessary to raise these nations’ economic circumstances and educational levels, as birth rates are lower in nations that are wealthier and more educated. In particular, efforts that raise women’s educational levels are especially important if contraceptive use is to increase. In all of these respects, we once again see the importance of a sociological perspective centering on the significance of socioeconomic inequality.</p>
            <p class="simpara">Urbanization Issues</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p05">Many urban issues are not, strictly speaking, sociological ones. For example, traffic congestion is arguably more of an engineering issue than a sociological issue, even if traffic congestion has many social consequences. Other urban issues are issues discussed in previous chapters that disproportionately affect urban areas. For example, crime is more common in urban areas than elsewhere, and racial and ethnic inequality is much more of an issue in urban areas than rural areas because of the concentration of people of color in our cities. Previous chapters have discussed such issues in some detail, and the strategies suggested by a sociological perspective for addressing these issues need not be repeated here.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkan-ch19_s04_s03_p06">Still other urban issues exist that this chapter was the first to present. Two of these involve crowding and housing. Cities are certainly crowded, and some parts of cities are especially crowded. Housing is expensive, and many urban residents live in dilapidated, substandard housing. Here again a sociological perspective offers some insight, as it reminds us that these problems are intimately related to inequalities of social class, race and ethnicity, and gender. Although it is critical to provide adequate, affordable housing to city residents, it is also important to remember that these various social inequalities affect who is in most need of such housing. Ultimately, strategies aimed at providing affordable housing will not succeed unless they recognize the importance of these social inequalities and unless other efforts reduce or eliminate these inequalities. Racial residential segregation also remains a serious problem in our nation’s urban centers, and sociologists have repeatedly shown that residential segregation contributes to many of the problems that urban African Americans experience. Reducing such segregation must be a fundamental goal of any strategy to help American cities.</p>
