    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_p01">If we want to reduce violent crime and other serious deviance, we must first understand why it occurs. Many sociological theories of deviance exist, and together they offer a more complete understanding of deviance than any one theory offers by itself. Together they help answer the questions posed earlier: why rates of deviance differ within social categories and across locations, why some behaviors are more likely than others to be considered deviant, and why some kinds of people are more likely than others to be considered deviant and to be punished for deviant behavior. As a whole, sociological explanations highlight the importance of the social environment and of social interaction for deviance and the commision of crime. As such, they have important implications for how to reduce these behaviors. Consistent with this book’s public sociology theme, a discussion of several such crime-reduction strategies concludes this chapter.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Functionalist Explanations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_p01">Several explanations may be grouped under the functionalist perspective in sociology, as they all share this perspective’s central view on the importance of various aspects of society for social stability and other social needs.</p>
        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Émile Durkheim: The Functions of Deviance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p01">As noted earlier, Émile Durkheim said deviance is normal, but he did not stop there. In a surprising and still controversial twist, he also argued that deviance serves several important functions for society.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p02">First, Durkheim said, deviance clarifies social norms and increases conformity. This happens because the discovery and punishment of deviance reminds people of the norms and reinforces the consequences of violating them. If your class were taking an exam and a student was caught cheating, the rest of the class would be instantly reminded of the rules about cheating and the punishment for it, and as a result they would be less likely to cheat.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p03">A second function of deviance is that it strengthens social bonds among the people reacting to the deviant. An example comes from the classic story <em class="emphasis">The Ox-Bow Incident</em> (Clark, 1940),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_005">Clark, W. V. T. (1940). <em class="emphasis">The ox-bow incident</em>. New York, NY: Random House.</span> in which three innocent men are accused of cattle rustling and are eventually lynched. The mob that does the lynching is very united in its frenzy against the men, and, at least at that moment, the bonds among the individuals in the mob are extremely strong.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p04">A final function of deviance, said Durkheim, is that it can help lead to positive social change. Although some of the greatest figures in history—Socrates, Jesus, Joan of Arc, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. to name just a few—were considered the worst kind of deviants in their time, we now honor them for their commitment and sacrifice.</p>

                <p class="para">Émile Durkheim wrote that deviance can lead to positive social change. Many Southerners had strong negative feelings about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement, but history now honors him for his commitment and sacrifice.</p>

(1996). <em class="emphasis">The war against the poor: The underclass and antipoverty policy</em>. New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> pointed to an additional function of deviance: deviance creates jobs for the segments of society—police, prison guards, criminology professors, and so forth—whose main focus is to deal with deviants in some manner. If deviance and crime did not exist, hundreds of thousands of law-abiding people in the United States would be out of work!</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p06">Although deviance can have all of these functions, many forms of it can certainly be quite harmful, as the story of the mugged voter that began this chapter reminds us. Violent crime and property crime in the United States victimize millions of people and households each year, while crime by corporations has effects that are even more harmful, as we discuss later. Drug use, prostitution, and other “victimless” crimes may involve willing participants, but these participants often cause themselves and others much harm. Although deviance according to Durkheim is inevitable and normal and serves important functions, that certainly does not mean the United States and other nations should be happy to have high rates of serious deviance. The sociological theories we discuss point to certain aspects of the social environment, broadly defined, that contribute to deviance and crime and that should be the focus of efforts to reduce these behaviors.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p01">An important sociological approach, begun in the late 1800s and early 1900s by sociologists at the University of Chicago, stresses that certain social and physical characteristics of urban neighborhoods raise the odds that people growing up and living in these neighborhoods will commit deviance and crime. This line of thought is now called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social ecology approach</a><span class="glossdef">The view that certain characteristics of neighborhoods and communities influence the likelihood of committing deviance and crime.</span></span> (Mears, Wang, Hay, &amp; Bales, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_007">Mears, D.

                <p class="simpara">Improving Neighborhood Conditions Helps Reduce Crime Rates</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p02">One of the sociological theories of crime discussed in the text is the social ecology approach. To review, this approach attributes high rates of deviance and crime to the neighborhood’s social and physical characteristics, including poverty, high population density, dilapidated housing, and high population turnover. These problems create social disorganization that weakens the neighborhood’s social institutions and impairs effective child socialization.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p03">Much empirical evidence supports social ecology’s view about negative neighborhood conditions and crime rates and suggests that efforts to improve these conditions will lower crime rates. Some of the most persuasive evidence comes from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (directed by sociologist Robert J. Sampson), in which more than 6,000 children, ranging in age from birth to 18, and their parents and other caretakers were studied over a 7-year period. The social and physical characteristics of the dozens of neighborhoods in which the subjects lived were measured to permit assessment of these characteristics’ effects on the probability of delinquency. A number of studies using data from this project confirm the general assumptions of the social ecology approach. In particular, delinquency is higher in neighborhoods with lower levels of “collective efficacy,” that is, in neighborhoods with lower levels of community supervision of adolescent behavior.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p04">The many studies from the Chicago project and data in several other cities show that neighborhood conditions greatly affect the extent of delinquency in urban neighborhoods. This body of research in turn suggests that strategies and programs that improve the social and physical conditions of urban neighborhoods may well help decrease the high rates of crime and delinquency that are so often found there.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p01">Failure to achieve the American dream lies at the heart of Robert Merton’s (1938)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_010">Merton, R. K. (1938). Social structure and anomie. <em class="emphasis">American Sociological Review, 3,</em> 672–682.</span> famous <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strain theory</a><span class="glossdef">Robert Merton’s view that deviance is caused by a failure to achieve the American goal of financial success through the conventional means of working.</span></span> (also called anomie theory). Recall from <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch01#barkan-ch01">Chapter 1 "Sociology and the Sociological Perspective"</a> that Durkheim attributed high rates of suicide to anomie, or normlessness, that occurs in times when social norms are unclear or weak. Adapting this concept, Merton wanted to explain why poor people have higher deviance rates than the nonpoor. He reasoned that the United States values economic success above all else and also has norms that specify the approved means, working, for achieving economic success. Because the poor often cannot achieve the American dream of success through the conventional means of working, they experience a gap between the goal of economic success and the means of working. This gap, which Merton likened to Durkheim’s anomie because of the resulting lack of clarity over norms, leads to strain or frustration. To reduce their frustration, some poor people resort to several adaptations, including deviance, depending on whether they accept or reject the goal of economic success and the means of working. <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_t01">Table 7.2 "Merton’s Anomie Theory"</a> presents the logical adaptations of the poor to the strain they experience.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p02">Despite their strain, most poor people continue to accept the goal of economic success and continue to believe they should work to make money. In other words, they continue to be good, law-abiding citizens. They conform to society’s norms and values, and, not surprisingly, Merton calls their adaptation <em class="emphasis">conformity</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p03">Faced with strain, some poor people continue to value economic success but come up with new means of achieving it. They rob people or banks, commit fraud, or use other illegal means of acquiring money or property. Merton calls this adaptation <em class="emphasis">innovation</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p04">Other poor people continue to work at a job without much hope of greatly improving their lot in life. They go to work day after day as a habit. Merton calls this third adaptation <em class="emphasis">ritualism</em>. This adaptation does not involve deviant behavior but is a logical response to the strain poor people experience.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p05">In Merton’s fourth adaptation, <em class="emphasis">retreatism</em>, some poor people withdraw from society by becoming hobos or vagrants or by becoming addicted to alcohol, heroin, or other drugs. Their response to the strain they feel is to reject both the goal of economic success and the means of working.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p06">Merton’s fifth and final adaptation is <em class="emphasis">rebellion</em>. Here poor people not only reject the goal of success and the means of working but work actively to bring about a new society with a new value system. These people are the radicals and revolutionaries of their time. Because Merton developed his strain theory in the aftermath of the Great Depression, in which the labor and socialist movements had been quite active, it is not surprising that he thought of rebellion as a logical adaptation of the poor to their lack of economic success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p07">Although Merton’s theory has been popular over the years, it has some limitations. Perhaps most important, it overlooks deviance such as fraud by the middle and upper classes and also fails to explain murder, rape, and other crimes that usually are not done for economic reasons. It also does not explain why some poor people choose one adaptation over another.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p08">Merton’s strain theory stimulated other explanations of deviance that built on his concept of strain. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Differential opportunity theory</a><span class="glossdef">Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin’s view that differential access to illegitimate means helps determine the types of deviance in which poor people engage.</span></span>, developed by Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin (1960),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_011">Cloward, R. A., &amp; Ohlin, L. E. (1960). <em class="emphasis">Delinquency and opportunity: A theory of delinquent gangs</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> tried to explain why the poor choose one or the other of Merton’s adaptations. Whereas Merton stressed that the poor have <em class="emphasis">differential access to legitimate means</em> (working), Cloward and Ohlin stressed that they have <em class="emphasis">differential access to illegitimate means</em>. For example, some live in neighborhoods where organized crime is dominant and will get involved in such crime; others live in neighborhoods rampant with drug use and will start using drugs themselves.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p09">In a more recent formulation, two sociologists, Steven F. Messner and Richard Rosenfeld (2007),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_012">Messner, S. F., &amp; Rosenfeld, R. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Crime and the American dream</em>. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> expanded Merton’s view by arguing that in the United States crime arises from several of our most important values, including an overemphasis on economic success, individualism, and competition. These values produce crime by making many Americans, rich or poor, feel they never have enough money and by prompting them to help themselves even at other people’s expense. Crime in the United States, then, arises ironically from the country’s most basic values.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p10">In yet another extension of Merton’s theory, Robert Agnew (2007)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_013">Agnew, R. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Pressured into crime: An overview of general strain theory</em>. Los Angeles, CA: Roxbury.</span> reasoned that adolescents experience various kinds of strain in addition to the economic type addressed by Merton. A romantic relationship may end, a family member may die, or students may be taunted or bullied at school. Repeated strain-inducing incidents such as these produce anger, frustration, and other negative emotions, and these emotions in turn prompt delinquency and drug use.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Deviant Subcultures</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s04_p01">Some sociologists stress that poverty and other community conditions give rise to certain subcultures through which adolescents acquire values that promote deviant behavior. One of the first to make this point was Albert K. Cohen (1955),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_014">Cohen, A. K. (1955). <em class="emphasis">Delinquent boys: The culture of the gang</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> whose <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">status frustration theory</a><span class="glossdef">Albert Cohen’s view that delinquency results from school failure and the concomitant need to regain self-esteem by being successful in delinquent activities.</span></span> says that lower-class boys do poorly in school because schools emphasize middle-class values. School failure reduces their status and self-esteem, which the boys try to counter by joining juvenile gangs. In these groups, a different value system prevails, and boys can regain status and self-esteem by engaging in delinquency. Cohen had nothing to say about girls, as he assumed they cared little about how well they did in school, placing more importance on marriage and family instead, and hence would remain nondelinquent even if they did not do well. Scholars later criticized his disregard for girls and assumptions about them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s04_p02">Another sociologist, Walter Miller (1958),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_015">Miller, W. B. (1958). Lower class culture as a generating milieu of gang delinquency. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social Issues, 14</em>, 5–19.</span> said poor boys become delinquent because they live amid a lower-class subculture that includes several <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focal concerns</a><span class="glossdef">Walter Miller’s term for the key values of lower-class subcultures.</span></span>, or values, that help lead to delinquency. These focal concerns include a taste for trouble, toughness, cleverness, and excitement. If boys grow up in a subculture with these values, they are more likely to break the law. Their deviance is a result of their socialization. Critics said Miller exaggerated the differences between the value systems in poor inner-city neighborhoods and wealthier, middle-class communities (Akers &amp; Sellers, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_016">Akers, R.

London, England: Social Science Paperbacks.</span> In some inner-city areas, they said, a subculture of violence promotes a violent response to insults and other problems, which people in middle-class areas would probably ignore. The subculture of violence, they continued, arises partly from the need of lower-class males to “prove” their masculinity in view of their economic failure. Quantitative research to test their theory has failed to show that the urban poor are more likely than other groups to approve of violence (Cao, Adams, &amp; Jensen, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_018">Cao, L., Adams, A., &amp; Jensen, V.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Social Control Theory</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s05_p01">Travis Hirschi (1969)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_020">Hirschi, T. (1969). <em class="emphasis">Causes of delinquency</em>. Berkeley: University of California Press.</span> argued that human nature is basically selfish and thus wondered why people do <em class="emphasis">not</em> commit deviance. His answer, which is now called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social control theory</a><span class="glossdef">Travis Hirschi’s view that deviance results from weak bonds to conventional social institutions, such as the family and schools.</span></span> (also known as <em class="emphasis">social bonding theory</em>), was that their bonds to conventional social institutions such as the family and the school keep them from violating social norms. Hirschi’s basic perspective reflects Durkheim’s view that strong social norms reduce deviance such as suicide.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s05_p02">Hirschi outlined four types of bonds to conventional social institutions: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief.</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s05_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Attachment</em> refers to how much we feel loyal to these institutions and care about the opinions of people in them, such as our parents and teachers. The more attached we are to our families and schools, the less likely we are to be deviant.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Commitment</em> refers to how much we value our participation in conventional activities such as getting a good education. The more committed we are to these activities and the more time and energy we have invested in them, the less deviant we will be.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Involvement</em> refers to the amount of time we spend in conventional activities. The more time we spend, the less opportunity we have to be deviant.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Belief</em> refers to our acceptance of society’s norms. The more we believe in these norms, the less we deviate.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s01_s05_p03">Hirschi’s theory has been very popular. Many studies find that youths with weaker bonds to their parents and schools are more likely to be deviant. But the theory has its critics (Akers &amp; Sellers, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_021">Akers, R. L., &amp; Sellers, C. S. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Criminological theories: Introduction, evaluation, and application</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> One problem centers on the chicken-and-egg question of causal order. For example, many studies support social control theory by finding that delinquent youths often have worse relationships with their parents than do nondelinquent youths. Is that because the bad relationships prompt the youths to be delinquent, as Hirschi thought? Or is it because the youths’ delinquency worsens their relationship with their parents? Despite these questions, Hirschi’s social control theory continues to influence our understanding of deviance. To the extent it is correct, it suggests several strategies for preventing crime, including programs designed to improve parenting and relations between parents and children (Welsh &amp; Farrington, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_022">Welsh, B.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflict and Feminist Explanations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Explanations of crime rooted in the conflict perspective reflect its general view that society is a struggle between the “haves” at the top of society with social, economic, and political power and the “have-nots” at the bottom. Accordingly, they assume that those with power pass laws and otherwise use the legal system to secure their position at the top of society and to keep the powerless on the bottom (Bohm &amp; Vogel, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_023">Bohm, R. M., &amp; Vogel, B. (2011). <em class="emphasis">A Primer on crime and delinquency theory</em> (3rd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> The poor and minorities are more likely because of their poverty and race to be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned. These explanations also blame street crime by the poor on the economic deprivation and inequality in which they live rather than on any moral failings of the poor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_p02">Some conflict explanations also say that capitalism helps create street crime by the poor. An early proponent of this view was Dutch criminologist Willem Bonger (1916),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_024">Bonger, W. (1916). <em class="emphasis">Criminality and economic conditions</em> (H. P. Horton, Trans.). Boston, MA: Little, Brown.</span> who said that capitalism as an economic system involves competition for profit. This competition leads to an emphasis in a capitalist society’s culture on <em class="emphasis">egoism</em>, or self-seeking behavior, and <em class="emphasis">greed</em>. Because profit becomes so important, people in a capitalist society are more likely than those in noncapitalist ones to break the law for profit and other gains, even if their behavior hurts others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_p03">Not surprisingly, conflict explanations have sparked much controversy (Akers &amp; Sellers, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_025">Akers, R. L., &amp; Sellers, C. S. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Criminological theories: Introduction, evaluation, and application</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> Many scholars dismiss them for painting an overly critical picture of the United States and ignoring the excesses of noncapitalistic nations, while others say the theories overstate the degree of inequality in the legal system. In assessing the debate over conflict explanations, a fair conclusion is that their view on discrimination by the legal system applies more to victimless crime (discussed in a later section) than to conventional crime, where it is difficult to argue that laws against such things as murder and robbery reflect the needs of the powerful. However, much evidence supports the conflict assertion that the poor and minorities face disadvantages in the legal system (Reiman &amp; Leighton, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_026">Reiman, J., &amp; Leighton, P. (2010). <em class="emphasis">The rich get richer and the poor get prison: Ideology, class, and criminal justice</em> (9th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Simply put, the poor cannot afford good attorneys, private investigators, and the other advantages that money brings in court. As just one example, if someone much poorer than O. J. Simpson, the former football player and media celebrity, had been arrested, as he was in 1994, for viciously murdering two people, the defendant would almost certainly have been found guilty. Simpson was able to afford a defense costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and won a jury acquittal in his criminal trial (Barkan, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_027">Barkan, S.

Albany, NY: Harrow and Heston.</span> Also in accordance with conflict theory’s views, corporate executives, among the most powerful members of society, often break the law without fear of imprisonment, as we shall see in our discussion of white-collar crime later in this chapter. Finally, many studies support conflict theory’s view that the roots of crimes by poor people lie in social inequality and economic deprivation (Barkan, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_028">Barkan, S.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Feminist Perspectives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p01">Feminist perspectives on crime and criminal justice also fall into the broad rubric of conflict explanations and have burgeoned in the last two decades. Much of this work concerns rape and sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and other crimes against women that were largely neglected until feminists began writing about them in the 1970s (Griffin, 1971).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_029">Griffin, S. (1971, September). Rape: The all-American crime. <em class="emphasis">Ramparts, 10</em>, 26–35.</span> Their views have since influenced public and official attitudes about rape and domestic violence, which used to be thought as something that girls and women brought on themselves. The feminist approach instead places the blame for these crimes squarely on society’s inequality against women and antiquated views about relations between the sexes (Renzetti, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_030">Renzetti, C. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Feminist criminology</em>. Manuscript submitted for publication.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p02">Another focus of feminist work is gender and legal processing. Are women better or worse off than men when it comes to the chances of being arrested and punished? After many studies in the last two decades, the best answer is that we are not sure (Belknap, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_031">Belknap, J. (2007). <em class="emphasis">The invisible woman: Gender, crime, and justice.</em> Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> Women are treated a little more harshly than men for minor crimes and a little less harshly for serious crimes, but the gender effect in general is weak.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p03">A third focus concerns the gender difference in serious crime, as women and girls are much less likely than men and boys to engage in violence and to commit serious property crimes such as burglary and motor vehicle theft. Most sociologists attribute this difference to gender socialization. Simply put, socialization into the male gender role, or masculinity, leads to values such as competitiveness and behavioral patterns such as spending more time away from home that all promote deviance. Conversely, despite whatever disadvantages it may have, socialization into the female gender role, or femininity, promotes values such as gentleness and behavior patterns such as spending more time at home that help limit deviance (Chesney-Lind &amp; Pasko, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_032">Chesney-Lind, M., &amp; Pasko, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_p01">Because symbolic interactionism focuses on the means people gain from their social interaction, symbolic interactionist explanations attribute deviance to various aspects of the social interaction and social processes that normal individuals experience. These explanations help us understand why some people are more likely than others living in the same kinds of social environments. Several such explanations exist.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Differential Association Theory</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s01_p01">One popular set of explanations, often called <em class="emphasis">learning theories</em>, emphasizes that deviance is learned from interacting with other people who believe it is OK to commit deviance and who often commit deviance themselves. Deviance, then, arises from normal socialization processes. The most influential such explanation is Edwin H. Sutherland’s (1947)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_034">Sutherland, E. H. (1947). <em class="emphasis">Principles of criminology</em>. Philadelphia, PA: J. P. Lippincott.</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">differential association theory</a><span class="glossdef">Edwin Sutherland’s view that deviance stems from interacting with primary group members who commit deviance and have values conducive to deviance.</span></span>, which says that criminal behavior is learned by interacting with close friends and family members. These individuals teach us not only how to commit various crimes but also the values, motives, and rationalizations that we need to adopt in order to justify breaking the law. The earlier in our life that we associate with deviant individuals and the more often we do so, the more likely we become deviant ourselves. In this way, a normal social process, socialization, can lead normal people to commit deviance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s01_p02">Sutherland’s theory of differential association was one of the most influential sociological theories ever. Over the years much research has documented the importance of adolescents’ peer relationships for their entrance into the world of drugs and delinquency (Akers &amp; Sellers, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_035">Akers, R. L., &amp; Sellers, C. S. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Criminological theories: Introduction, evaluation, and application</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> However, some critics say that not all deviance results from the influences of deviant peers. Still, differential association theory and the larger category of learning theories it represents remain a valuable approach to understanding deviance and crime.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Labeling Theory</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p01">If we arrest and imprison someone, we hope they will be “scared straight,” or deterred from committing a crime again. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Labeling theory</a><span class="glossdef">The view that extralegal factors affect whether someone acquires a deviant label and that being labeled deviant increases the chances of future deviance.</span></span> assumes precisely the opposite: it says that labeling someone deviant increases the chances that the labeled person will continue to commit deviance. According to labeling theory, this happens because the labeled person ends up with a deviant self-image that leads to even more deviance. Deviance is the result of being labeled (Bohm &amp; Vogel, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_036">Bohm, R. M., &amp; Vogel, B. (2011). <em class="emphasis">A primer on crime and delinquency theory</em> (3rd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p02">This effect is reinforced by how society treats someone who has been labeled. Research shows that job applicants with a criminal record are much less likely than those without a record to be hired (Pager, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_037">Pager, D. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Marked: Race, crime, and finding work in an era of mass incarceration</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> Suppose you had a criminal record and had seen the error of your ways but were rejected by several potential employers. Do you think you might be just a little frustrated? If your unemployment continues, might you think about committing a crime again? Meanwhile, you want to meet some law-abiding friends, so you go to a singles bar. You start talking with someone who interests you, and in response to this person’s question, you say you are between jobs. When your companion asks about your last job, you reply that you were in prison for armed robbery. How do you think your companion will react after hearing this? As this scenario suggests, being labeled deviant can make it difficult to avoid a continued life of deviance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p03">Labeling theory also asks whether some people and behaviors are indeed more likely than others to acquire a deviant label. In particular, it asserts that nonlegal factors such as appearance, race, and social class affect how often official labeling occurs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p04">William Chambliss’s (1973)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn07_038">Chambliss, W. J. (1973).

The Saints were eight male high-school students from middle-class backgrounds who were very delinquent, while the Roughnecks were six male students in the same high school who were also very delinquent but who came from poor, working-class families. Although the Saints’ behavior was arguably more harmful than the Roughnecks’, their actions were considered harmless pranks, and they were never arrested. After graduating from high school, they went on to college and graduate and professional school and ended up in respectable careers. In contrast, the Roughnecks were widely viewed as troublemakers and often got into trouble for their behavior. As adults they either ended up in low-paying jobs or went to prison.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p05">Labeling theory’s views on the effects of being labeled and on the importance of nonlegal factors for official labeling remain controversial. Nonetheless, the theory has greatly influenced the study of deviance and crime in the last few decades and promises to do so for many years to come.</p>

                    <li>Several functionalist explanations exist. Durkheim highlighted the functions that deviance serves for society. Merton’s strain theory assumed that deviance among the poor results from their inability to achieve the economic success so valued in American society. Other explanations highlight the role played by the social and physical characteristics of urban neighborhoods, of deviant subcultures, and of weak bonds to social institutions.</li>
                    <li>Conflict explanations assume that the wealthy and powerful use the legal system to protect their own interests and to keep the poor and racial minorities subservient. Feminist perspectives highlight the importance of gender inequality for crimes against women and of male socialization for the gender difference in criminality.</li>
                    <li>Interactionist explanations highlight the importance of social interaction in the commitment of deviance and in reactions to deviance. Labeling theory assumes that the labeling process helps ensure that someone will continue to commit deviance, and it also assumes that some people are more likely than others to be labeled deviant because of their appearance, race, social class, and other characteristics.</li>
