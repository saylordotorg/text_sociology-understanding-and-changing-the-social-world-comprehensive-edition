    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_p01">To understand this problem further, we need to take a critical look at the very meaning of race and ethnicity in today’s society. These concepts may seem easy to define initially but are much more complex than their definitions suggest.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Race</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p01">Let’s start first with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">race</a><span class="glossdef">A category of people who share certain inherited physical characteristics, such as skin color, facial features, and stature.</span></span>, which refers to a category of people who share certain inherited physical characteristics, such as skin color, facial features, and stature. A key question about race is whether it is more of a biological category or a social category. Most people think of race in biological terms, and for more than 300 years, or ever since white Europeans began colonizing populations of color elsewhere in the world, race has indeed served as the “premier source of human identity” (Smedley, 1998, p. 690).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_015">Smedley, A. (1998). “Race” and the construction of human identity. <em class="emphasis">American Anthropologist, 100</em>, 690–702.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p02">It is certainly easy to see that people in the United States and around the world differ physically in some obvious ways. The most noticeable difference is skin tone: some groups of people have very dark skin, while others have very light skin. Other differences also exist. Some people have very curly hair, while others have very straight hair. Some have thin lips, while others have thick lips. Some groups of people tend to be relatively tall, while others tend to be relatively short. Using such physical differences as their criteria, scientists at one point identified as many as nine races: African, American Indian or Native American, Asian, Australian Aborigine, European (more commonly called “white”), Indian, Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian (Smedley, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_016">Smedley, A. (1998). “Race” and the construction of human identity. <em class="emphasis">American Anthropologist, 100</em>, 690–702.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p03">Although people certainly do differ in the many physical features that led to the development of such racial categories, anthropologists, sociologists, and many biologists question the value of these categories and thus the value of the biological concept of race (Smedley, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_017">Smedley, A. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Race in North America: Evolution of a worldview</em>. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.</span> For one thing, we often see more physical differences <em class="emphasis">within</em> a race than <em class="emphasis">between</em> races. For example, some people we call “white” (or European), such as those with Scandinavian backgrounds, have very light skins, while others, such as those from some Eastern European backgrounds, have much darker skins. In fact, some “whites” have darker skin than some “blacks,” or African Americans. Some whites have very straight hair, while others have very curly hair; some have blonde hair and blue eyes, while others have dark hair and brown eyes. Because of interracial reproduction going back to the days of slavery, African Americans also differ in the darkness of their skin and in other physical characteristics. In fact it is estimated that about 80% of African Americans have some white (i.e., European) ancestry; 50% of Mexican Americans have European or Native American ancestry; and 20% of whites have African or Native American ancestry. If clear racial differences ever existed hundreds or thousands of years ago (and many scientists doubt such differences ever existed), in today’s world these differences have become increasingly blurred.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p04">Another reason to question the biological concept of race is that an individual or a group of individuals is often assigned to a race on arbitrary or even illogical grounds. A century ago, for example, Irish, Italians, and Eastern European Jews who left their homelands for a better life in the United States were not regarded as white once they reached the United States but rather as a different, inferior (if unnamed) race (Painter, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_018">Painter, N. I. (2010). <em class="emphasis">The history of white people</em>. New York, NY: W. W. Norton.</span> The belief in their inferiority helped justify the harsh treatment they suffered in their new country. Today, of course, we call people from all three backgrounds white or European.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p05">In this context, consider someone in the United States who has a white parent and a black parent. What race is this person? American society usually calls this person black or African American, and the person may adopt the same identity (as does Barack Obama, who had a white mother and African father). But where is the logic for doing so? This person, as well as President Obama, is as much white as black in terms of parental ancestry. Or consider someone with one white parent and another parent who is the child of one black parent and one white parent. This person thus has three white grandparents and one black grandparent. Even though this person’s ancestry is thus 75% white and 25% black, she or he is likely to be considered black in the United States and may well adopt this racial identity. This practice reflects the traditional “one-drop rule” in the United States that defines someone as black if she or he has at least one drop of “black blood,” and that was used in the antebellum South to keep the slave population as large as possible (Wright, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_019">Wright, L. (1993, July 12). One drop of blood. <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker,</em> pp. 46–54.</span> Yet in many Latin American nations, this person would be considered white. In Brazil, the term <em class="emphasis">black</em> is reserved for someone with no European (white) ancestry at all. If we followed this practice in the United States, about 80% of the people we call “black” would now be called “white.” With such arbitrary designations, race is more of a social category than a biological one.</p>

            <p class="para">President Barack Obama had an African father and a white mother. Although his ancestry is equally black and white, Obama considers himself an African American, as do most Americans. In several Latin American nations, however, Obama would be considered white because of his white ancestry.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p06">A third reason to question the biological concept of race comes from the field of biology itself and more specifically from the studies of genetics and human evolution. Starting with genetics, people from different races are more than 99.9% the same in their DNA (Begley, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_020">Begley, S. (2008, February 29). Race and DNA. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/lab-notes/2008/02/29/race-and-dna.html">http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/lab-notes/2008/02/29/race-and-dna.html</a></span> To turn that around, less than 0.1% of all the DNA in our bodies accounts for the physical differences among people that we associate with racial differences. In terms of DNA, then, people with different racial backgrounds are much, much more similar than dissimilar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_p07">Even if we acknowledge that people differ in the physical characteristics we associate with race, modern evolutionary evidence reminds us that we are all, really, of one human race. According to evolutionary theory, the human race began thousands and thousands of years ago in sub-Saharan Africa. As people migrated around the world over the millennia, natural selection took over. It favored dark skin for people living in hot, sunny climates (i.e., near the equator), because the heavy amounts of melanin that produce dark skin protect against severe sunburn, cancer, and other problems. By the same token, natural selection favored light skin for people who migrated farther from the equator to cooler, less sunny climates, because dark skins there would have interfered with the production of vitamin D (Stone &amp; Lurquin, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_021">Stone, L., &amp; Lurquin, P. F. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Genes, culture, and human evolution: A synthesis</em>. Malden, MA: Blackwell.</span> Evolutionary evidence thus reinforces the common humanity of people who differ in the rather superficial ways associated with their appearances: we are one human species composed of people who happen to look different.</p>
        <div class="section" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Race as a Social Construction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p01">The reasons for doubting the biological basis for racial categories suggest that race is more of a social category than a biological one. Another way to say this is that race is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social construction</a><span class="glossdef">A concept that has no objective reality but rather is what people decide it is.</span></span>, a concept that has no objective reality but rather is what people decide it is (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1963).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_022">Berger, P., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1963). <em class="emphasis">The social construction of reality</em>. New York, NY: Doubleday.</span> In this view race has no real existence other than what and how people think of it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p02">This understanding of race is reflected in the problems, outlined earlier, in placing people with multiracial backgrounds into any one racial category. We have already mentioned the example of President Obama. As another example, the famous (and now notorious) golfer Tiger Woods was typically called an African American by the news media when he burst onto the golfing scene in the late 1990s, but in fact his ancestry is one-half Asian (divided evenly between Chinese and Thai), one-quarter white, one-eighth Native American, and only one-eighth African American (Leland &amp; Beals, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_023">Leland, J., &amp; Beals, G. (1997, May 5). In living colors: Tiger Woods is the exception that rules. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> 58–60.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p03">Historical examples of attempts to place people in racial categories further underscore the social constructionism of race. In the South during the time of slavery, the skin tone of slaves lightened over the years as babies were born from the union, often in the form of rape, of slave owners and other whites with slaves. As it became difficult to tell who was “black” and who was not, many court battles over people’s racial identity occurred. People who were accused of having black ancestry would go to court to prove they were white in order to avoid enslavement or other problems (Staples, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_024">Staples, B. (1998, November 13). The shifting meanings of “black” and “white,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, p. WK14.</span> Litigation over race continued long past the days of slavery. In a relatively recent example, Susie Guillory Phipps sued the Louisiana Bureau of Vital Records in the early 1980s to change her official race to white. Phipps was descended from a slave owner and a slave and thereafter had only white ancestors. Despite this fact, she was called “black” on her birth certificate because of a state law, echoing the “one-drop rule,” that designated people as black if their ancestry was at least 1/32 black (meaning one of their great-great-great grandparents was black). Phipps had always thought of herself as white and was surprised after seeing a copy of her birth certificate to discover she was officially black because she had one black ancestor about 150 years earlier. She lost her case, and the U.S. Supreme Court later refused to review it (Omi &amp; Winant, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn10_025">Omi, M., &amp; Winant, H. (1994). <em class="emphasis">Racial formation in the United States: From the 1960s to the 1990s</em> (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Routledge.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p04">Although race is a social construction, it is also true, as noted in an earlier chapter, that things perceived as real are real in their consequences. Because people <em class="emphasis">do</em> perceive race as something real, it has real consequences. Even though so little of DNA accounts for the physical differences we associate with racial differences, that low amount leads us not only to classify people into different races but to treat them differently—and, more to the point, unequally—based on their classification. Yet modern evidence shows there is little, if any, scientific basis for the racial classification that is the source of so much inequality.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ethnicity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s02_p01">Because of the problems in the meaning of <em class="emphasis">race</em>, many social scientists prefer the term <em class="emphasis">ethnicity</em> in speaking of people of color and others with distinctive cultural heritages. In this context, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethnicity</a><span class="glossdef">The shared social, cultural, and historical experiences, stemming from common national or regional backgrounds, that make subgroups of a population different from one another.</span></span> refers to the shared social, cultural, and historical experiences, stemming from common national or regional backgrounds, that make subgroups of a population different from one another. Similarly, an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethnic group</a><span class="glossdef">A subgroup of a population with a set of shared social, cultural, and historical experiences; with relatively distinctive beliefs, values, and behaviors; and with some sense of identity of belonging to the subgroup.</span></span> is a subgroup of a population with a set of shared social, cultural, and historical experiences; with relatively distinctive beliefs, values, and behaviors; and with some sense of identity of belonging to the subgroup. So conceived, the terms <em class="emphasis">ethnicity</em> and <em class="emphasis">ethnic group</em> avoid the biological connotations of the terms <em class="emphasis">race</em> and <em class="emphasis">racial group</em> and the biological differences these terms imply. At the same time, the importance we attach to ethnicity illustrates that it, too, is in many ways a social construction, and our ethnic membership thus has important consequences for how we are treated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s02_p02">The sense of identity many people gain from belonging to an ethnic group is important for reasons both good and bad. Because, as we learned in <a class="xref" href="barkan-ch06#barkan-ch06">Chapter 6 "Groups and Organizations"</a>, one of the most important functions of groups is the identity they give us, ethnic identities can give individuals a sense of belonging and a recognition of the importance of their cultural backgrounds. This sense of belonging is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch10_s02_s02_f01">Figure 10.1 "Responses to “How Close Do You Feel to Your Ethnic or Racial Group?”"</a>, which depicts the answers of General Social Survey respondents to the question, “How close do you feel to your ethnic or racial group?” More than three-fourths said they feel close or very close. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethnic pride</a><span class="glossdef">The sense of self-worth that many people derive from their ethnic backgrounds.</span></span> captures the sense of self-worth that many people derive from their ethnic backgrounds. More generally, if group membership is important for many ways in which members of the group are socialized, ethnicity certainly plays an important role in the socialization of millions of people in the United States and elsewhere in the world today.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch10_s02_s02_p03">A downside of ethnicity and ethnic group membership is the conflict they create among people of different ethnic groups. History and current practice indicate that it is easy to become prejudiced against people with different ethnicities from our own. Much of the rest of this chapter looks at the prejudice and discrimination operating today in the United States against people whose ethnicity is not white and European. Around the world today, ethnic conflict continues to rear its ugly head. The 1990s and 2000s were filled with “ethnic cleansing” and pitched battles among ethnic groups in Eastern Europe, Africa, and elsewhere. Our ethnic heritages shape us in many ways and fill many of us with pride, but they also are the source of much conflict, prejudice, and even hatred, as the hate crime story that began this chapter so sadly reminds us.</p>
