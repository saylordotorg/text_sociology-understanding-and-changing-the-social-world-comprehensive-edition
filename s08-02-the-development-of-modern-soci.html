    <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_p01">To help understand how modern society developed, sociologists find it useful to distinguish societies according to their type of economy and technology. One of the most useful schemes distinguishes the following types of societies: <em class="emphasis">hunting-and-gathering</em>, <em class="emphasis">horticultural</em>, <em class="emphasis">pastoral</em>, <em class="emphasis">agricultural</em>, and <em class="emphasis">industrial</em> (Nolan &amp; Lenski, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn05_003">Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Human societies: An introduction to macrosociology</em> (11th ed.). Boulder, CO: Paradigm.</span> Some scholars add a final type, <em class="emphasis">postindustrial</em>, to the end of this list. We now outline the major features of each type in turn. <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch05_s02_t01">Table 5.1 "Summary of Societal Development"</a> summarizes these features.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Hunting-and-Gathering Societies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s01_p01">Beginning about 250,000 years ago, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hunting-and-gathering societies</a><span class="glossdef">Societies of a few dozen members whose food is obtained from hunting animals and gathering plants and vegetation.</span></span> are the oldest ones we know of; few of them remain today, partly because modern societies have encroached on their existence. As the name <em class="emphasis">hunting-and-gathering</em> implies, people in these societies both hunt for food and gather plants and other vegetation. They have few possessions other than some simple hunting-and-gathering equipment. To ensure their mutual survival, everyone is expected to help find food and also to share the food they find. To seek their food, hunting-and-gathering peoples often move from place to place. Because they are nomadic, their societies tend to be quite small, often consisting of only a few dozen people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Beyond this simple summary of the type of life these societies lead, anthropologists have also charted the nature of social relationships in them. One of their most important findings is that hunting-and-gathering societies are fairly egalitarian. Although men do most of the hunting and women most of the gathering, perhaps reflecting the biological differences between the sexes discussed earlier, women and men in these societies are roughly equal. Because hunting-and-gathering societies have few possessions, their members are also fairly equal in terms of wealth and power, as virtually no wealth exists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Horticultural and Pastoral Societies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Horticultural and pastoral societies both developed about 10,000–12,000 years ago. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">horticultural societies</a><span class="glossdef">Societies that use hoes and other simple tools to raise small amounts of crops.</span></span>, people use hoes and other simple hand tools to raise crops. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pastoral societies</a><span class="glossdef">Societies that raise livestock as their primary source of food.</span></span>, people raise and herd sheep, goats, camels, and other domesticated animals and use them as their major source of food and also, depending on the animal, as a means of transportation. Some societies are either primarily horticultural or pastoral, while other societies combine both forms. Pastoral societies tend to be at least somewhat nomadic, as they often have to move to find better grazing land for their animals. Horticultural societies, on the other hand, tend to be less nomadic, as they are able to keep growing their crops in the same location for some time. Both types of societies often manage to produce a surplus of food from vegetable or animal sources, respectively, and this surplus allows them to trade their extra food with other societies. It also allows them to have a larger population size than hunting-and-gathering societies that often reaches several hundred members.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Accompanying the greater complexity and wealth of horticultural and pastoral societies is greater inequality in terms of gender and wealth than is found in hunting-and-gathering societies. In pastoral societies, wealth stems from the number of animals a family owns, and families with more animals are wealthier and more powerful than families with fewer animals. In horticultural societies, wealth stems from the amount of land a family owns, and families with more land are wealthier and more powerful.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s02_p03">One other side effect of the greater wealth of horticultural and pastoral societies is greater conflict. As just mentioned, sharing of food is a key norm in hunting-and-gathering societies. In horticultural and pastoral societies, however, wealth (and more specifically, the differences in wealth) leads to disputes and even fighting over land and animals. Whereas hunting-and-gathering peoples tend to be very peaceful, horticultural and pastoral peoples tend to be more aggressive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Agricultural Societies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Agricultural societies</a><span class="glossdef">Societies that cultivate large amounts of crops with plows and other relatively advanced tools and equipment.</span></span> developed some 5,000 years ago in the Middle East, thanks to the invention of the plow. When pulled by oxen and other large animals, the plow allowed for much more cultivation of crops than the simple tools of horticultural societies permitted. The wheel was also invented about the same time, and written language and numbers began to be used. The development of agricultural societies thus marked a watershed in the development of human society. Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome were all agricultural societies, and India and many other large nations today remain primarily agricultural.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s03_p02">We have already seen that the greater food production of horticultural and pastoral societies led them to become larger than hunting-and-gathering societies and to have more trade and greater inequality and conflict. Agricultural societies continue all these trends. First, because they produce so much more food than horticultural and pastoral societies, they often become quite large, with their numbers sometimes reaching into the millions. Second, their huge food surpluses lead to extensive trade, both within the society itself and with other societies. Third, the surpluses and trade both lead to degrees of wealth unknown in the earlier types of societies and thus to unprecedented inequality, exemplified in the appearance for the first time of peasants, people who work on the land of rich landowners. Finally, agricultural societies’ greater size and inequality also produce more conflict. Some of this conflict is internal, as rich landowners struggle with each other for even greater wealth and power, and peasants sometimes engage in revolts. Other conflict is external, as the governments of these societies seek other markets for trade and greater wealth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s03_p03">If gender inequality becomes somewhat greater in horticultural and pastoral societies than in hunting-and-gathering ones, it becomes very pronounced in agricultural societies. An important reason for this is the hard, physically taxing work in the fields, much of it using large plow animals, that characterizes these societies. Then, too, women are often pregnant in these societies, because large families provide more bodies to work in the fields and thus more income. Because men do more of the physical labor in agricultural societies—labor on which these societies depend—they have acquired greater power over women (Brettell &amp; Sargent, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn05_004">Brettell, C. B., &amp; Sargent, C. F. (Eds.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Gender in cross-cultural perspective</em> (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> In the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, agricultural societies are much more likely than hunting-and-gathering ones to believe men should dominate women (see <a class="xref" href="#barkan-ch05_s02_s03_f01">Figure 5.2 "Type of Society and Presence of Cultural Belief That Men Should Dominate Women"</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Industrial Societies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Industrial societies</a><span class="glossdef">Large societies that rely on machines and factories as their primary modes of economic production.</span></span> emerged in the 1700s as the development of machines and then factories replaced the plow and other agricultural equipment as the primary mode of production. The first machines were steam- and water-powered, but eventually, of course, electricity became the main source of power. The growth of industrial societies marked such a great transformation in many of the world’s societies that we now call the period from about 1750 to the late 1800s the Industrial Revolution. This revolution has had enormous consequences in almost every aspect of society, some for the better and some for the worse.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s04_p02">On the positive side, industrialization brought about technological advances that improved people’s health and expanded their life spans. As noted earlier, there is also a greater emphasis in industrial societies on individualism, and people in these societies typically enjoy greater political freedom than those in older societies. Compared to agricultural societies, industrial societies also have lowered economic and gender inequality. In industrial societies, people do have a greater chance to pull themselves up by their bootstraps than was true in earlier societies, and rags-to-riches stories continue to illustrate the opportunity available under industrialization. That said, we will see in later chapters that economic and gender inequality remains substantial in many industrial societies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s04_p03">On the negative side, industrialization meant the rise and growth of large cities and concentrated poverty and degrading conditions in these cities, as the novels of Charles Dickens poignantly remind us. This urbanization changed the character of social life by creating a more impersonal and less traditional <em class="emphasis">Gesellschaft</em> society. It also led to riots and other urban violence that, among other things, helped fuel the rise of the modern police force and forced factory owners to improve workplace conditions. Today industrial societies consume most of the world’s resources, pollute its environment to an unprecedented degree, and have compiled nuclear arsenals that could undo thousands of years of human society in an instant.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Postindustrial Societies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s05_p01">We are increasingly living in what has been called the <em class="emphasis">information technology age</em> (or just <em class="emphasis">information age</em>), as wireless technology vies with machines and factories as the basis for our economy. Compared to industrial economies, we now have many more service jobs, ranging from housecleaning to secretarial work to repairing computers. Societies in which this transition is happening are moving from an industrial to a postindustrial phase of development. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">postindustrial societies</a><span class="glossdef">Societies in which information technology and service jobs have replaced machines and manufacturing jobs as the primary dimension of the economy.</span></span>, then, information technology and service jobs have replaced machines and manufacturing jobs as the primary dimension of the economy (Bell, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn05_005">Bell, D. (Ed.). (1999). <em class="emphasis">The coming of post-industrial society: A venture in social forecasting</em>. New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> If the car was the sign of the economic and social times back in the 1920s, then the smartphone or netbook/laptop is the sign of the economic and social future in the early years of the 21st century. If the factory was the dominant workplace at the beginning of the 20th century, with workers standing at their positions by conveyor belts, then cell phone, computer, and software companies are dominant industries at the beginning of the 21st century, with workers, almost all of them much better educated than their earlier factory counterparts, huddled over their wireless technology at home, at work, or on the road. In short, the Industrial Revolution has been replaced by the Information Revolution, and we now have what has been called an <em class="emphasis">information society</em> (Hassan, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn05_006">Hassan, R. (2008). <em class="emphasis">The information society: Cyber dreams and digital nightmares</em>. Malden, MA: Polity.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkan-ch05_s02_s05_p02">As part of postindustrialization in the United States, many manufacturing companies have moved their operations from U.S. cities to overseas sites. Since the 1980s, this process has raised unemployment in cities, many of whose residents lack the college education and other training needed in the information sector. Partly for this reason, some scholars fear that the information age will aggravate the disparities we already have between the “haves” and “have-nots” of society, as people lacking a college education will have even more trouble finding gainful employment than they do now (W. J. Wilson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-barkan-fn05_007">Wilson, W. J. (2009). The economic plight of inner-city black males. In E. Anderson (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Against the wall: Poor, young, black, and male</em> (pp. 55–70). Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</span> In the international arena, postindustrial societies may also have a leg up over industrial or, especially, agricultural societies as the world moves ever more into the information age.</p>
